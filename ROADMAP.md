## Part 1: Detailed Rule Specifications

### 1.3 Performance Rules

#### Memory Optimization

| Rule Name | Tier | Severity | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|

#### Network Performance

| Rule Name | Tier | Severity | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|

### 1.4 Testing Rules

#### Unit Testing

#### Integration Testing

| Rule Name | Tier | Severity | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| ℹ️ `require_test_ordering` | Professional | INFO | Integration tests may depend on database state from previous tests. Document dependencies or use `setUp` to ensure required state. |
| ℹ️ `prefer_retry_flaky` | Comprehensive | INFO | Integration tests on real devices are inherently flaky. Configure retry count in CI (e.g., `--retry=2`) rather than deleting useful tests. |
| ℹ️ `prefer_test_data_reset` | Professional | INFO | Each test should start with known state. Reset database, clear shared preferences, and log out users in setUp to prevent test pollution. |
| ℹ️ `avoid_screenshot_in_ci` | Comprehensive | INFO | Screenshots in CI consume storage and slow tests. Take screenshots only on failure for debugging, not on every test. |
| ℹ️ `prefer_test_report` | Comprehensive | INFO | Generate JUnit XML or JSON reports for CI dashboards. Raw console output is hard to track over time. |
| ℹ️ `require_performance_test` | Professional | INFO | Measure frame rendering time and startup latency in integration tests. Catch performance regressions before they reach production. |
| ℹ️ `avoid_test_on_real_device` | Recommended | INFO | Real devices vary in performance and state. Use emulators/simulators in CI for consistent, reproducible results. |
| ℹ️ `prefer_parallel_tests` | Comprehensive | INFO | Independent integration tests can run in parallel with `--concurrency`. Reduces total CI time significantly for large test suites. |

### 1.5 Security Rules
