    #
    # --- TIER 1: ESSENTIAL (263 rules) ---
    #
    - always_remove_listener: true  # [WARNING] Listener added but may not be removed.
    - avoid_android_cleartext_traffic: true  # [WARNING] HTTP URL detected. Android 9+ blocks cleartext traffic by default. This request will fail silently.
    - avoid_animation_rebuild_waste: true  # [WARNING] AnimatedBuilder wraps too much of the widget tree, causing unnecessary rebuilds and wasted CPU cycles. This can degrade animation performance, increase battery usage, and make your app feel sluggish, especially on lower-end devices.
    - avoid_api_key_in_code: true  # [ERROR] Hardcoded keys are extractable from app binaries, enabling unauthorized API access and billing abuse.
    - avoid_app_links_sensitive_params: true  # [ERROR] Deep link params are logged by OS and analytics, exposing tokens in crash reports and logs.
    - avoid_assert_in_production: true  # [WARNING] assert() is compiled out of release builds by the Dart compiler. Any validation, input checking, or security enforcement using assert() will silently stop running in production, allowing invalid data, unauthorized access, or corrupted state to pass through unchecked.
    - avoid_assigning_notifiers: true  # [ERROR] Reassigning Notifier breaks provider contract. State updates are lost and listeners receive stale data.
    - avoid_async_callback_in_fake_async: true  # [ERROR] Async callback uses real time, making tests hang or timeout instead of using controlled fake time.
    - avoid_async_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Build method should never be async. This will cause rendering issues.
    - avoid_auth_in_query_params: true  # [ERROR] Query params are logged in server logs, browser history, and referrer headers, leaking auth tokens.
    - avoid_bloc_context_dependency: true  # [WARNING] Bloc depending on BuildContext couples business logic to the UI layer. This makes the Bloc untestable in isolation, prevents reuse across widgets, and can cause crashes when the context becomes invalid after the widget is removed from the tree.
    - avoid_bloc_event_mutation: true  # [ERROR] If BLoC events are mutable, they can be modified during processing, causing race conditions, unpredictable state changes, and hard-to-debug bugs. This breaks the contract of event immutability and can destabilize your app.
    - avoid_builder_index_out_of_bounds: true  # [WARNING] itemBuilder accesses list without bounds check. If the index is out of bounds due to list changes, this will cause runtime exceptions, app crashes, and unpredictable UI behavior. This is a common source of production bugs in dynamic lists and can lead to negative user reviews.
    - avoid_catch_all: true  # [WARNING] Bare catch clause without an on-type hides the specific error type being caught and silently swallows critical failures like OutOfMemoryError and StackOverflowError. This can mask fatal programming bugs, making them impossible to detect in crash reports or monitoring systems.
    - avoid_catch_exception_alone: true  # [WARNING] Using "on Exception catch" without an "on Object catch" fallback silently misses all Error types including StateError, TypeError, and RangeError. These programming errors will crash the app without being logged or reported, making production debugging extremely difficult.
    - avoid_circular_dependencies: true  # [WARNING] Service class constructor depends on another service of the same architectural layer (both end with Service, Repository, Controller, etc.). This creates circular dependency chains that break initialization order, prevent unit testing with mocks, and produce tightly coupled modules that cannot be modified or deployed independently.
    - avoid_circular_provider_deps: true  # [ERROR] Circular dependencies between providers cause stack overflows, infinite loops, and unpredictable initialization order. This leads to runtime crashes, hard-to-debug errors, and broken state management. If not fixed, your app may crash or behave unpredictably in production. Always design provider graphs to be acyclic for reliability and maintainability.
    - avoid_circular_redirects: true  # [WARNING] GoRoute redirect callback always returns a path and never returns null, creating an unconditional redirect that forms an infinite loop. The router exhausts the redirect limit and throws an exception, crashing the app or permanently locking users out of all navigation when the redirect chain has no termination condition.
    - avoid_clearing_form_on_error: true  # [WARNING] Form fields are cleared when validation fails, destroying all user input. Users lose their partially-correct data and must re-enter everything from scratch. This frustrating pattern increases form abandonment, wastes user time, and creates a hostile experience that drives users away from completing the form submission.
    - avoid_clipboard_sensitive: true  # [WARNING] Clipboard contents persist and are readable by other apps, exposing passwords and tokens.
    - avoid_conditional_hooks: true  # [ERROR] Hook function called conditionally. Hooks must be called unconditionally in the same order.
    - avoid_context_across_async: true  # [ERROR] BuildContext used after await crashes if widget was disposed during the async gap. Check mounted first.
    - avoid_context_after_await_in_static: true  # [ERROR] BuildContext used after await in static method. Context may be invalid after async gap.
    - avoid_context_after_navigation: true  # [WARNING] BuildContext accessed after an awaited navigation call without a mounted check. The widget that owns this context is likely disposed by the time the await completes, and calling ScaffoldMessenger.of(), Navigator.of(), or Theme.of() on a disposed context throws a FlutterError that crashes the app or produces silent failures in release mode.
    - avoid_datetime_now_in_tests: true  # [WARNING] DateTime.now() in tests produces non-deterministic values that vary between runs, causing flaky assertions that pass locally but fail in CI, making test failures impossible to reproduce reliably.
    - avoid_deep_link_sensitive_params: true  # [ERROR] Deep link query parameter contains sensitive data (password, token, secret, API key, or credential), creating a security breach. Deep link URLs are recorded in system logs, browser history, HTTP referrer headers, and analytics platforms, permanently exposing credentials to attackers who gain access to those logs or the device history.
    - avoid_deprecated_crypto_algorithms: true  # [WARNING] The use of outdated cryptographic algorithms such as MD5, SHA1, DES, 3DES, and RC4 exposes your application to well-known attacks. These algorithms have been broken by the security community: MD5 and SHA1 are vulnerable to collision and preimage attacks, allowing attackers to forge digital signatures or tamper with data. DES and 3DES have insufficient key lengths and are susceptible to brute-force attacks, while RC4 is vulnerable to several biases and key recovery attacks. Continuing to use these algorithms puts all encrypted or hashed data at risk of compromise, regardless of other security measures.
    - avoid_dialog_context_after_async: true  # [ERROR] If you call Navigator.pop() or use BuildContext after an await, the widget may have been disposed, causing a "Looking up deactivated widget" crash. This leads to app instability and poor user experience.
    - avoid_dialog_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Calling showDialog (or similar) inside build() will cause your app to enter an infinite loop, repeatedly showing dialogs and freezing the UI. This results in a poor user experience and may crash the app.
    - avoid_double_for_money: true  # [ERROR] Floating point causes rounding errors in money calculations. $0.1 + $0.2 != $0.3, causing financial loss.
    - avoid_duplicate_bloc_event_handlers: true  # [ERROR] Second handler for same event type is ignored, causing silent bugs when expected logic runs.
    - avoid_duplicate_map_keys: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate key in map literal silently overwrites the earlier value, causing data loss and unpredictable behavior. Only the last value assigned to the key will persist in the resulting map.
    - avoid_duplicate_widget_keys: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate widget keys found in list.
    - avoid_dynamic_code_loading: true  # [ERROR] Dynamic code loading at runtime bypasses compile-time dependency verification, allowing execution of unverified code and creating supply chain attack vectors.
    - avoid_dynamic_sql: true  # [ERROR] Constructing SQL queries by concatenating or interpolating user input directly into the query string exposes your application to SQL injection attacks. Attackers can craft input that alters the structure of your query, allowing them to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data, escalate privileges, or compromise the entire database. SQL injection is one of the most critical and well-documented security vulnerabilities in software development, and has led to major data breaches across industries.
    - avoid_eval_like_patterns: true  # [ERROR] Dynamic code execution allows arbitrary code injection, enabling attackers to execute malicious code.
    - avoid_existing_instances_in_bloc_provider: true  # [ERROR] Returning an existing bloc instance from BlocProvider(create: ...) causes the bloc to be closed when the provider disposes, even if it is still used elsewhere. This can lead to unexpected state loss, runtime errors, and hard-to-debug bugs. Always use the correct provider pattern for new vs. existing blocs.
    - avoid_expanded_outside_flex: true  # [ERROR] Expanded without Row/Column parent throws FlutterError, crashing the app at runtime.
    - avoid_external_storage_sensitive: true  # [ERROR] External storage is world-readable on Android, exposing credentials to any installed app.
    - avoid_flashing_content: true  # [WARNING] Flashing >3Hz can trigger seizures in users with photosensitive epilepsy. WCAG 2.3.1 compliance required.
    - avoid_functions_in_register_singleton: true  # [WARNING] registerSingleton expects an instance, not a factory function.
    - avoid_future_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Creating Future in build() causes repeated async calls on every rebuild.
    - avoid_getx_context_outside_widget: true  # [WARNING] Get.context or Get.overlayContext used outside widget class. This is unsafe and may cause crashes.
    - avoid_global_key_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Creating a GlobalKey inside the build() method causes it to be recreated on every rebuild, which results in lost widget state, broken references, and unpredictable UI behavior. This can cause your app to lose user input or fail to maintain state across rebuilds.
    - avoid_go_router_inline_creation: true  # [WARNING] GoRouter instance created inside build() is destroyed and recreated on every widget rebuild. This resets all navigation state including the current route stack, destroys in-flight transitions, breaks hot reload during development, and causes users to lose their navigation position whenever the parent widget rebuilds.
    - avoid_hardcoded_config: true  # [WARNING] Hardcoded configuration makes code inflexible and deployment-specific.
    - avoid_hardcoded_credentials: true  # [ERROR] Hardcoding credentials (such as passwords, API keys, or tokens) in source code exposes them to anyone with access to the codebase, including public repositories and version control history. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised systems. Credentials should always be stored securely and never committed to version control.
    - avoid_hardcoded_encryption_keys: true  # [ERROR] Hardcoded encryption keys present in source code or binaries can be easily extracted by attackers using reverse engineering tools. Once exposed, these keys allow adversaries to decrypt all user data protected by the key, resulting in a complete compromise of confidentiality for every user of your application. This vulnerability is especially critical in mobile and web apps, where binaries are distributed to end users. Hardcoded keys are often found in test code, examples, or as quick fixes, but they must never be used in production or shipped code. Attackers routinely scan for such patterns, and automated tools can detect and extract these secrets within minutes of release.
    - avoid_hidden_interactive: true  # [ERROR] This interactive element uses excludeFromSemantics, making it completely inaccessible to screen readers and users with assistive technologies. Excluding interactive child elements from the semantics tree prevents users with disabilities from discovering or activating key actions, which fails accessibility standards and can break critical workflows.
    - avoid_hive_field_index_reuse: true  # [ERROR] Reusing Hive field indexes across different fields or types can corrupt your database, cause data loss, and make migrations impossible. This can result in users losing critical data or experiencing app crashes after updates. Always assign unique field indexes and never change them after release. See https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/adapters/fields.
    - avoid_hooks_outside_build: true  # [ERROR] Hook function called outside of build method. Hooks must only be called from build().
    - avoid_ignoring_ssl_errors: true  # [ERROR] Bypassing or ignoring SSL/TLS certificate errors disables the core security guarantees of HTTPS, allowing man-in-the-middle attackers to intercept, modify, or steal all data sent over the network. This exposes user credentials, tokens, and sensitive personal data to silent compromise, and is a leading cause of real-world security breaches. SSL validation must never be disabled in production code.
    - avoid_inherited_widget_in_initstate: true  # [WARNING] Avoid accessing InheritedWidget in initState.
    - avoid_instantiating_in_bloc_value_provider: true  # [ERROR] Creating a new bloc instance inside BlocProvider.value prevents the bloc from being automatically closed, leading to memory leaks and unpredictable state. This is a critical resource management issue that can degrade app performance and reliability.
    - avoid_instantiating_in_value_provider: true  # [ERROR] Creating a new instance inside Provider.value prevents proper lifecycle management, leading to memory leaks, resource retention, and unpredictable behavior. This is a critical issue for stateful objects like ChangeNotifiers and ValueListenables.
    - avoid_ios_in_app_browser_for_auth: true  # [ERROR] OAuth URL detected in WebView. Google and Apple block OAuth via in-app WebView for security reasons.
    - avoid_isar_enum_field: true  # [ERROR] Storing enums directly in Isar collections is dangerous: renaming or reordering enum values will silently corrupt your data, breaking existing records and causing unpredictable bugs.
    - avoid_keyboard_overlap: true  # [INFO] TextField may be hidden by keyboard. No viewInsets handling found.
    - avoid_late_final_reassignment: true  # [WARNING] Late final field may be assigned multiple times.
    - avoid_listen_in_async: true  # [WARNING] Using context.watch() inside an async callback triggers widget rebuilds during asynchronous execution, creating stale closures that capture outdated state. This causes data races where async operations complete with wrong values, leading to corrupted state or duplicate side effects.
    - avoid_loading_full_pdf_in_memory: true  # [WARNING] Loading an entire PDF file into memory can cause out-of-memory errors, especially on mobile devices with limited RAM. This can crash the app, degrade performance, and prevent users from viewing large documents.
    - avoid_logging_sensitive_data: true  # [ERROR] Logging sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or personally identifiable information (PII) exposes users to privacy risks and can result in data leaks if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties. Sensitive information in logs may appear in crash reports, debug output, or be inadvertently shared with third parties, leading to compliance violations and loss of user trust. Always sanitize logs to prevent exposure of confidential data.
    - avoid_long_running_isolates: true  # [WARNING] Long-running isolate detected. iOS kills background tasks after ~30 seconds. Design tasks to complete quickly.
    - avoid_losing_stack_trace: true  # [WARNING] Rethrowing without preserving the stack trace loses the original error location and call chain. Production debugging becomes impossible because crash reports show only the rethrow site, not where the error actually originated. Always capture and forward the full stack trace.
    - avoid_macos_catalyst_unsupported_apis: true  # [WARNING] API detected that is not available on Mac Catalyst. Add platform check if supporting Mac Catalyst.
    - avoid_mixed_environments: true  # [ERROR] Mixing production and development configuration in your codebase creates serious security vulnerabilities. Debug APIs may expose sensitive data, development endpoints can corrupt production databases, and credentials may leak to unauthorized users. This can result in data breaches, compliance violations, and loss of user trust. Environment-specific configuration must be strictly separated and managed.
    - avoid_mounted_in_setstate: true  # [WARNING] Checking the mounted property inside a setState callback is an anti-pattern. If the widget is not mounted, setState should not be called at all. Placing the check inside the callback can lead to subtle bugs and unnecessary state updates, as the widget’s lifecycle should be validated before attempting to update state.
    - avoid_multiple_material_apps: true  # [ERROR] Multiple MaterialApp widgets detected in widget tree.
    - avoid_mutable_field_in_equatable: true  # [ERROR] Equatable classes should only have final fields. Mutable fields break value equality, causing bugs in collections, state management, and UI updates. Changing a field after object creation makes == and hashCode unreliable.
    - avoid_nested_scaffolds: true  # [ERROR] Avoid nesting Scaffold widgets inside other Scaffolds.
    - avoid_notification_same_id: true  # [WARNING] Static or hardcoded notification ID causes newer notifications to silently replace older ones using the same identifier. Users will miss important alerts, messages, and time-sensitive updates without any indication that previous notifications were overwritten, leading to lost information and degraded communication reliability.
    - avoid_notification_silent_failure: true  # [WARNING] Notification operation without error handling. Failures will be silent and hard to debug.
    - avoid_null_assertion: true  # [INFO] Avoid using the null assertion operator (!). It can cause runtime crashes if the value is null.
    - avoid_openai_key_in_code: true  # [ERROR] Hardcoded OpenAI keys are extractable from binaries, enabling API abuse charged to your account.
    - avoid_optional_field_crash: true  # [ERROR] JSON field accessed with direct bracket notation on a Map that may contain null values. When the API response omits an optional field, this direct access throws a runtime exception that crashes the app. Defensive null-aware access with ?[] prevents unexpected null pointer errors and provides graceful handling of incomplete or malformed JSON responses.
    - avoid_overlapping_animations: true  # [WARNING] Multiple animations targeting the same property (e.g., opacity, position, scale) at the same time cause visual jitter, unpredictable results, and confusing UI behavior. Overlapping animations can make transitions hard to follow and degrade user experience, especially for users with cognitive or visual disabilities.
    - avoid_parameter_mutation: true  # [WARNING] Parameter object is being mutated. This modifies the caller's data.
    - avoid_path_traversal: true  # [WARNING] File paths constructed from user input may allow path traversal attacks (e.g., "../"), enabling access to sensitive files outside the intended directory. This is a critical security risk.
    - avoid_platform_channel_on_web: true  # [ERROR] MethodChannel throws MissingPluginException on web, crashing the application.
    - avoid_print_error: true  # [WARNING] Using print() for error logging in a catch block. In production, print() output is not captured by crash reporting services like Crashlytics or Sentry, making errors invisible to monitoring dashboards. Errors logged only via print() are effectively lost and cannot trigger alerts or be tracked over time.
    - avoid_print_in_release: true  # [ERROR] Using print() in production exposes debug information to end users, can leak sensitive data, and negatively impacts performance. Print statements are not optimized for release builds and may clutter logs, making it harder to diagnose real issues. This can also violate privacy policies and app store guidelines.
    - avoid_provider_value_rebuild: true  # [WARNING] Provider.value with inline object creation recreates the notifier on every widget build. This discards accumulated user data, resets form state, and can trigger infinite rebuild loops that freeze the UI as each rebuild creates a new instance that triggers another rebuild.
    - avoid_purchase_in_sandbox_production: true  # [ERROR] Hardcoded IAP environment URL detected. Sandbox receipts fail in production and vice versa.
    - avoid_recursive_widget_calls: true  # [ERROR] Widget creates instance of itself, causing infinite recursion.
    - avoid_redirect_injection: true  # [WARNING] Redirect URL read from a parameter or user input without domain validation creates an open redirect vulnerability. Attackers craft URLs pointing to your app that redirect victims to phishing sites, credential harvesters, or malware downloads while appearing to originate from your trusted domain.
    - avoid_ref_in_build_body: true  # [ERROR] Using ref.read() in build() does not trigger widget rebuilds when the provider changes, leading to stale UI, missed updates, and confusing bugs. This breaks the reactive model of Riverpod and can cause your app to display outdated information.
    - avoid_ref_in_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Using ref in dispose() is unsafe because the provider may already be destroyed, leading to runtime errors, crashes, or accessing invalid state. This can cause unpredictable bugs and app instability.
    - avoid_ref_inside_state_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Ref may already be disposed when dispose() runs, causing "already disposed" errors or crashes.
    - avoid_ref_read_inside_build: true  # [WARNING] ref.read() called inside build() bypasses Riverpod reactivity. The widget will not rebuild when the provider state changes, resulting in stale data displayed to the user. This creates inconsistent UI state that fails silently and produces hard-to-diagnose rendering errors across dependent widgets.
    - avoid_ref_watch_outside_build: true  # [ERROR] ref.watch() detected outside build() method, breaking the Riverpod widget lifecycle. Subscriptions created outside build() leak memory, produce stale data, and cause missed UI updates that lead to inconsistent state and hard-to-debug rendering errors across dependent widgets.
    - avoid_riverpod_state_mutation: true  # [WARNING] State mutated directly. Mutations don't trigger rebuilds.
    - avoid_scroll_listener_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Scroll listener registered in build() accumulates duplicate subscriptions on every widget rebuild. Each rebuild adds another listener that is never removed, causing memory leaks, duplicate callback executions, and progressively degrading scroll performance as listeners compound over the widget lifecycle.
    - avoid_sensitive_data_in_clipboard: true  # [WARNING] Copying sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or personal information to the clipboard exposes users to data theft, as other apps or malicious actors can access clipboard contents. This is a significant privacy and security risk, especially on shared or compromised devices. See https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure.html and https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/Clipboard-class.html.
    - avoid_sensitive_in_logs: true  # [ERROR] Logging sensitive data (such as passwords, tokens, or personal information) exposes users to credential theft, privacy violations, and compliance failures (e.g., OWASP A09). Attackers or support staff may access logs and extract secrets, leading to data breaches.
    - avoid_setstate_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Calling setState inside the build() method causes the widget to rebuild recursively, leading to stack overflows, app crashes, and unpredictable UI behavior. This makes your app unstable and difficult to debug. Always trigger state changes outside build().
    - avoid_shared_prefs_in_isolate: true  # [ERROR] SharedPreferences used in isolate context. SharedPreferences does not work in isolates.
    - avoid_shared_prefs_sensitive_data: true  # [ERROR] SharedPreferences stores data as plaintext XML, readable via backup extraction or rooted device.
    - avoid_shrink_wrap_expensive: true  # [WARNING] shrinkWrap: true disables list virtualization, forcing Flutter to measure and lay out every item upfront instead of lazily building only visible items. For lists with many children, this causes slow initial rendering, high memory consumption, and jank during scrolling as the framework processes the entire list eagerly.
    - avoid_sqflite_type_mismatch: true  # [ERROR] SQLite type may not match Dart type. Booleans are stored as INTEGER (0/1), DateTime as TEXT/INTEGER.
    - avoid_storing_context: true  # [ERROR] Storing a BuildContext in a field or variable for later use is dangerous because the context may become invalid after the widget is disposed or rebuilt. Using a stale context can cause exceptions, show dialogs on the wrong screen, or trigger subtle bugs. This is a common source of crashes and hard-to-diagnose UI issues in Flutter apps.
    - avoid_storing_passwords: true  # [ERROR] SharedPreferences stores passwords in plaintext, readable by anyone with device access or backup.
    - avoid_storing_sensitive_unencrypted: true  # [ERROR] Unencrypted sensitive data exposed via device backup extraction or rooted device access, enabling identity theft.
    - avoid_stream_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Creating a Stream or StreamController inside a widget’s build() method causes a new stream instance to be created on every rebuild of that widget. This leads to multiple overlapping subscriptions, memory leaks, and lost or duplicated events, making the widget’s state unpredictable and difficult to debug. Always manage streams as persistent fields in the State class, not as local variables in build(). See https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/web-sockets#using-streambuilder.
    - avoid_supabase_anon_key_in_code: true  # [ERROR] Hardcoded keys can be extracted from app binary. Attackers gain direct access to your Supabase project.
    - avoid_swallowing_exceptions: true  # [WARNING] Catch block swallows exception without logging, rethrowing, or handling it. Silent failures hide production bugs, break monitoring and alerting systems, and make it impossible to diagnose issues reported by users. Every caught exception must be acknowledged.
    - avoid_test_sleep: true  # [WARNING] Avoid using sleep() or real delays in tests.
    - avoid_throw_in_finally: true  # [WARNING] Avoid throw in finally blocks.
    - avoid_token_in_url: true  # [ERROR] Tokens in URLs are logged in browser history, server logs, and referrer headers, exposing credentials.
    - avoid_unassigned_stream_subscriptions: true  # [WARNING] Stream subscription created by listen() is not assigned to a variable. Without a reference to the StreamSubscription, you cannot cancel it during dispose, which causes memory leaks, prevents garbage collection, and allows callbacks to fire after the StatefulWidget has been destroyed and unmounted from the widget tree.
    - avoid_unawaited_future: true  # [WARNING] Not awaiting a Future means any errors or exceptions it throws may be silently lost, leading to missed bugs and unreliable app behavior. This is especially risky in production code where error reporting is critical.
    - avoid_unbounded_cache_growth: true  # [WARNING] Map or collection used as a cache has no maximum size constraint. Without eviction logic, the cache grows indefinitely as new entries are added, consuming increasing amounts of device memory. This eventually exhausts available RAM and crashes the app with an out-of-memory error, particularly on mobile devices with limited memory resources.
    - avoid_uncaught_future_errors: true  # [WARNING] Fire-and-forget Future called without error handling. Any exception thrown by this Future is silently lost or crashes the app via the global error handler. Without .catchError(), try-catch, or .ignore(), async failures become invisible in production and extremely difficult to diagnose from crash logs.
    - avoid_undisposed_instances: true  # [WARNING] Disposable instance may not be properly disposed.
    - avoid_unreachable_for_loop: true  # [WARNING] For loop with impossible bounds will never execute, resulting in dead code. This often indicates a logic error, typo, or incorrect increment direction. Unreachable loops can hide bugs, confuse maintainers, and lead to missed updates or calculations.
    - avoid_unsafe_collection_methods: true  # [WARNING] .first/.last/.single on empty collection throws StateError, crashing the app.
    - avoid_unsafe_deserialization: true  # [WARNING] Unvalidated JSON from untrusted sources can crash the app, inject malicious data, or corrupt application state. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to trigger unexpected behavior, bypass security checks, or cause data loss by crafting malicious payloads.
    - avoid_unsafe_reduce: true  # [WARNING] Calling reduce() on an empty collection throws a StateError at runtime, crashing the app. Unlike fold(), reduce() has no initial value and requires at least one element to operate.
    - avoid_unsafe_where_methods: true  # [WARNING] firstWhere/lastWhere/singleWhere throws if no element matches.
    - avoid_unverified_native_library: true  # [ERROR] Loading native libraries from dynamic or absolute paths bypasses package verification, allowing attackers to substitute malicious native code.
    - avoid_user_controlled_urls: true  # [WARNING] Allowing user-controlled URLs to be loaded without validation exposes your app to security vulnerabilities such as phishing, open redirects, and malicious content injection. This can compromise user data and app integrity. Always validate and sanitize URLs before loading or displaying them. See https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet and https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter#security-considerations.
    - avoid_weak_cryptographic_algorithms: true  # [WARNING] Weak cryptographic algorithm detected.
    - avoid_web_only_dependencies: true  # [ERROR] Importing web-only libraries such as dart:html, dart:js, or dart:indexed_db in a Flutter or Dart app that targets mobile or desktop platforms will cause the app to crash with UnsupportedError at startup. This makes the app completely unusable for non-web users and can result in poor user experience, negative reviews, and lost users. Web-only dependencies must be isolated to web-specific code.
    - avoid_yield_in_on_event: true  # [ERROR] yield breaks Bloc 8.0+ concurrency and event ordering, causing unpredictable state updates.
    - check_is_not_closed_after_async_gap: true  # [ERROR] Emitting to closed Bloc throws StateError, crashing the app when widget is disposed during async.
    - dispose_class_fields: true  # [WARNING] Class has disposable fields but no dispose/close method. This may cause memory leaks.
    - dispose_provided_instances: true  # [WARNING] Provider creates a disposable instance without a dispose callback, causing memory leaks. Undisposed stream subscriptions and controllers persist after the parent StatefulWidget is removed from the tree, continuing to hold resources and fire callbacks that trigger setState-after-dispose errors.
    - emit_new_bloc_state_instances: true  # [ERROR] Mutating state object breaks equality checks, preventing BlocBuilder from detecting changes.
    - incorrect_firebase_event_name: true  # [ERROR] Invalid event name is silently dropped by Firebase Analytics. Your analytics data will be incomplete.
    - incorrect_firebase_parameter_name: true  # [ERROR] Invalid parameter names are silently dropped by Firebase. Event data will be missing fields.
    - list_all_equatable_fields: true  # [WARNING] Equatable class has fields not included in props. Equality checks fail silently when these fields differ, causing inconsistent behavior in collections, comparisons, and UI updates. Two objects with different field values will be treated as equal, leading to missed rebuilds, incorrect deduplication, and subtle bugs that are extremely hard to trace.
    - missing_test_assertion: true  # [WARNING] Test without assertions always passes, giving false confidence. Bugs slip through undetected.
    - pass_existing_future_to_future_builder: true  # [WARNING] Creating new Future in FutureBuilder restarts the async operation on every widget rebuild. This causes duplicate network calls, database queries, and slow UI with visible loading states.
    - pass_existing_stream_to_stream_builder: true  # [WARNING] Creating new Stream in StreamBuilder causes rebuilds.
    - prefer_copy_with_for_state: true  # [ERROR] Directly modifying BLoC state breaks immutability, leading to unpredictable UI updates, missed rebuilds, and subtle bugs that surface only in production. The BLoC pattern relies on immutable state transitions to guarantee that every emit triggers a rebuild; mutating fields in place silently bypasses this contract.
    - prefer_firebase_remote_config_defaults: true  # [INFO] Missing defaults cause null/zero values when fetch fails, breaking app behavior.
    - prefer_html_escape: true  # [WARNING] Displaying user-generated content in a WebView without proper HTML escaping exposes your app to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Malicious input can execute scripts, steal user data, or compromise device security. Always sanitize and escape user content before rendering it in a web context.
    - prefer_image_picker_max_dimensions: true  # [WARNING] pickImage() called without maxWidth or maxHeight parameters loads full-resolution camera images (12+ megapixels on modern devices). Decoding these large images into memory causes OutOfMemoryError crashes on lower-end devices, excessive memory consumption that triggers OS app kills, and slow image processing.
    - prefer_lazy_loading_images: true  # [WARNING] Image.network in ListView builder without lazy loading. All images load immediately, wasting bandwidth and memory.
    - prefer_pending_intent_flags: true  # [ERROR] PendingIntent without FLAG_IMMUTABLE or FLAG_MUTABLE crashes on Android 12+.
    - prefer_platform_io_conditional: true  # [ERROR] Platform class from dart:io throws UnsupportedError at runtime on Flutter web because dart:io is unavailable in browser environments. Accessing Platform.isAndroid, Platform.isIOS, or any Platform property without first checking kIsWeb crashes the web app immediately with an unrecoverable runtime error.
    - prefer_secure_random_for_crypto: true  # [WARNING] The default Random() constructor in Dart uses a seed based on the current system time, making its output predictable and vulnerable to attack. If Random() is used to generate cryptographic keys, initialization vectors (IVs), nonces, tokens, or any value intended to protect sensitive data, attackers can reproduce the same sequence of random numbers and break your security. This flaw has led to real-world breaches where cryptographic protections were bypassed due to weak randomness. Only a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) can provide the unpredictability required for security-critical operations.
    - prefer_timeout_on_requests: true  # [WARNING] Making HTTP requests without a timeout can cause your app to hang indefinitely if the server is slow or unresponsive. This degrades user experience and can block critical app flows.
    - prefer_try_parse_for_dynamic_data: true  # [ERROR] Using parse methods (like int.parse or double.parse) on dynamic or user-provided data can throw exceptions and crash your app if the input is invalid. This exposes your app to stability and security risks, especially when handling external or untrusted data. Always use tryParse to safely handle potentially malformed input and provide a fallback for invalid values. See https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/library-tour#numbers.
    - prefer_utc_for_storage: true  # [WARNING] Local time stored without UTC conversion causes incorrect values when restored in different timezones.
    - provide_correct_intl_args: true  # [ERROR] Intl.message args count does not match placeholders. This will cause runtime errors.
    - require_android_permission_request: true  # [ERROR] Permission-gated API called without runtime permission request. Android 6+ will deny access or crash.
    - require_animation_controller_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Neglecting to dispose of an AnimationController when a widget is removed from the tree causes memory leaks and can lead to performance degradation, as the controller continues to consume resources and tick animations in the background. This can eventually crash your app or cause unexpected behavior. Always dispose of AnimationControllers to maintain optimal app performance. See https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController/dispose.html.
    - require_animation_disposal: true  # [WARNING] Failing to dispose an AnimationController in the dispose() method causes it to retain resources, listeners, and animation frames, resulting in memory leaks and degraded performance. This is especially problematic in widgets that are frequently created and destroyed, such as in lists or navigation stacks, and can lead to app instability or crashes. Proper disposal is required for robust Flutter apps.
    - require_animation_ticker_disposal: true  # [ERROR] If you do not stop your Ticker in dispose(), it will continue running and leak memory, causing slowdowns and error messages. This can degrade performance and lead to crashes in long-running apps.
    - require_app_startup_error_handling: true  # [WARNING] runApp() is called without runZonedGuarded or FlutterError.onError. Uncaught errors during app startup will crash the application silently with no crash report sent to monitoring services. Users see a blank or frozen screen with no diagnostic information available to the development team.
    - require_apple_sign_in: true  # [ERROR] Third-party login detected without Sign in with Apple. iOS apps with social login must offer Sign in with Apple.
    - require_apple_signin_nonce: true  # [ERROR] Omitting a cryptographic nonce when using Apple Sign-In exposes your app to replay attacks. Attackers can intercept a valid authorization token and reuse it to impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to their account and sensitive data. Apple’s security documentation strongly recommends using a unique, random nonce for every authentication request to prevent these attacks and ensure user safety.
    - require_background_message_handler: true  # [WARNING] Push notifications received when app is terminated are silently dropped without handler.
    - require_bloc_close: true  # [ERROR] If you do not close your Bloc or Cubit in the StatefulWidget dispose() method, it will leak memory, keep stream subscriptions active, and cause app slowdowns or crashes. Always close Blocs and Cubits to prevent leaks and unexpected behavior after the widget tree is rebuilt.
    - require_bloc_manual_dispose: true  # [WARNING] Bloc or Cubit holds StreamController or Timer fields but does not override close() to dispose them. Undisposed resources cause memory leaks that accumulate across navigation, eventually increasing memory pressure until the operating system kills the app.
    - require_cache_key_determinism: true  # [ERROR] Cache key uses non-deterministic values (e.g., DateTime.now, Random, hashCode, or UUID). This causes cache misses, duplicated resources, and unpredictable behavior. Cache keys must uniquely and consistently identify the same resource for the same input. Using unstable values breaks cache integrity and wastes memory.
    - require_cached_image_dimensions: true  # [WARNING] CachedNetworkImage without cache dimensions loads full-resolution images into memory, causing out-of-memory errors and app crashes on devices with limited RAM. Large images (such as high-resolution photos from modern cameras) can consume hundreds of megabytes when decoded, quickly exhausting available memory.
    - require_camera_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Undisposed camera holds hardware exclusively, blocking other apps from accessing camera until app restart.
    - require_camera_permission_check: true  # [ERROR] Camera initialized without permission check. This crashes on iOS and throws on Android.
    - require_catch_logging: true  # [WARNING] Catch block swallows the exception without logging or rethrowing. Security-relevant errors such as authentication failures, permission violations, and data corruption go completely undetected. This prevents incident response, makes debugging production issues impossible, and hides potential attack activity.
    - require_cors_handling: true  # [ERROR] HTTP calls from a Flutter web app fail silently without proper CORS headers from the server. The browser blocks cross-origin requests by default, causing network errors that prevent data loading, authentication, and API communication. Users see blank screens or broken functionality with no clear error message.
    - require_data_encryption: true  # [WARNING] Unencrypted sensitive data exposes credentials to attackers via device access or backup extraction.
    - require_database_migration: true  # [WARNING] Database models must support versioned migrations to handle schema changes safely. Without migration logic, updates to the schema can break data, cause runtime errors, and result in data loss or corruption. This is a critical reliability and maintainability issue for any persistent storage solution.
    - require_date_format_specification: true  # [WARNING] DateTime.parse may fail on server dates due to format mismatches. Unspecified formats can cause runtime errors, silent failures, and broken data flows. This is a common source of bugs in internationalized and backend-driven apps.
    - require_deep_link_fallback: true  # [INFO] Deep link handler navigates to content without verifying the target exists or is accessible. When a deep link references deleted, restricted, or invalid content, the app either crashes with a null reference error or displays a blank screen. Users tapping expired links in emails, notifications, or shared messages encounter a broken experience.
    - require_deep_link_validation: true  # [WARNING] Deep link parameter used without validation allows attackers to craft malicious URLs that inject arbitrary data into your app. Unvalidated deep link parameters can cause crashes from unexpected types, unauthorized access to restricted screens, or execution of unintended actions on behalf of the user.
    - require_default_config: true  # [WARNING] Accessing configuration values without providing a default or fallback can cause runtime crashes if the value is missing or misconfigured. This leads to unpredictable app behavior, poor user experience, and failed startup. It may also result in app store rejection for reliability issues.
    - require_dio_error_handling: true  # [WARNING] Making a Dio HTTP request without wrapping it in a try-catch block means any DioException (such as network errors, timeouts, or invalid responses) will crash the app and leave users with no feedback. This is especially problematic in production apps where network conditions are unpredictable. Always handle Dio errors to provide a robust and user-friendly experience. See https://pub.dev/packages/dio#handling-errors.
    - require_dio_timeout: true  # [WARNING] Creating a Dio instance for network requests without setting connectTimeout and receiveTimeout in BaseOptions can cause HTTP requests to hang indefinitely if the server is slow or unresponsive. This can freeze the UI, degrade user experience, and make error recovery impossible, especially in mobile apps with unreliable networks. Always configure timeouts to ensure your app remains responsive and can handle network failures gracefully. See https://pub.dev/packages/dio#timeouts.
    - require_error_handling_in_async: true  # [WARNING] Async provider without error handling allows exceptions to propagate unhandled. Unhandled errors in FutureProvider or StreamProvider surface as uncaught exceptions that crash the app or leave the UI in a permanent loading state with no recovery path.
    - require_error_identification: true  # [WARNING] Error or alert states are indicated only by color, which is not accessible to users with color vision deficiencies. All error indicators must include a non-color cue such as an icon, text label, or pattern for full accessibility.
    - require_error_state: true  # [ERROR] If your BLoC state hierarchy does not include an error state, failures will be unhandled, leading to crashes or missing error UI. This makes your app less robust and harder to debug.
    - require_error_widget: true  # [WARNING] FutureBuilder/StreamBuilder must handle error state to prevent silent failures, blank screens, or cryptic UI. Without error handling, users may see no feedback when data fails to load, leading to confusion, poor UX, and support burden. This can also mask backend or network issues during development.
    - require_fcm_token_refresh_handler: true  # [WARNING] FCM tokens expire periodically. Without onTokenRefresh handling, push notifications will stop working.
    - require_feature_flag_default: true  # [WARNING] Missing default causes null/zero when remote config fetch fails, breaking expected feature behavior.
    - require_field_dispose: true  # [WARNING] Disposable field may not be properly disposed.

    - require_firebase_init_before_use: true  # [WARNING] Firebase services crash if accessed before initializeApp() completes. App fails on startup.
    - require_firestore_index: true  # [ERROR] Compound Firestore query may need a composite index. Query will fail at runtime without the required index.
    - require_focus_node_dispose: true  # [ERROR] FocusNode is not disposed. This causes memory leaks.
    - require_form_key: true  # [WARNING] Without GlobalKey, validate() and save() calls fail because FormState cannot be accessed.
    - require_form_key_in_stateful_widget: true  # [WARNING] GlobalKey<FormState> created inside the build() method is re-instantiated on every widget rebuild triggered by setState(). Each rebuild creates a new key, causing the form to lose all current field values, validation state, and user input. This produces a frustrating user experience where typed data disappears unpredictably during state changes.
    - require_geolocator_permission_check: true  # [ERROR] Accessing location without checking permission will crash your app on iOS and may cause unpredictable behavior on Android. This can result in app store rejection and poor user experience.
    - require_getit_registration_order: true  # [WARNING] GetIt registration uses a dependency not yet registered at this point in the setup sequence. This causes runtime errors when the service locator attempts to resolve an unregistered type, resulting in app crashes during startup or lazy initialization that are difficult to reproduce and debug in production.
    - require_getx_permanent_cleanup: true  # [WARNING] Get.put(permanent: true) registers a navigation, scroll, or animation controller that will never be automatically deleted. This can cause memory leaks if you do not manually clean up. Instances registered as permanent remain in memory for the lifetime of the app unless explicitly deleted. This is especially risky for feature-specific or page-scoped controllers that may not always be needed.
    - require_getx_worker_dispose: true  # [WARNING] GetX Worker field has no corresponding dispose() call in onClose(). Without disposing the Worker, its internal stream subscription remains active after the GetxController is destroyed. This creates a memory leak where the Worker, its closure, and all captured references are retained in memory indefinitely.
    - require_hive_adapter_registration_order: true  # [ERROR] Opening box before registering adapters throws HiveError. Adapters must be registered first.
    - require_hive_encryption_key_secure: true  # [ERROR] Hardcoded key defeats encryption. Anyone decompiling the app can decrypt all stored user data.

    - require_https_for_ios: true  # [WARNING] HTTP URL will be blocked by iOS App Transport Security unless exception is configured.
    - require_https_only: true  # [WARNING] HTTP URL detected in network request. Unencrypted HTTP traffic is vulnerable to interception, modification, and eavesdropping by any attacker on the network path. Sensitive data including credentials, personal information, and session tokens transmitted over HTTP can be silently captured in plaintext.
    - require_image_cache_dimensions: true  # [WARNING] Image.network loads the full-resolution image into memory without cacheWidth or cacheHeight constraints. A 4000x3000 pixel photo decodes to approximately 48MB of uncompressed bitmap data in memory. Without cache dimensions, displaying multiple images causes excessive memory consumption that leads to out-of-memory crashes on lower-end devices.
    - require_image_stream_dispose: true  # [WARNING] ImageStream listener is not removed in the dispose() method. The listener retains a reference to the widget State object, preventing garbage collection after the widget is removed from the tree. This creates a memory leak where decoded image data and the entire widget state remain allocated indefinitely, consuming device memory.
    - require_immutable_bloc_state: true  # [ERROR] If your BLoC state is mutable, it causes unpredictable UI updates, breaks state comparison, and leads to missed widget rebuilds. This results in subtle bugs, inconsistent UI, and hard-to-maintain code.
    - require_initial_state: true  # [ERROR] If a BLoC or Cubit does not provide an initial state, it will throw a LateInitializationError at runtime when BlocBuilder or BlocConsumer tries to read the state. This causes your app to crash and makes debugging difficult.
    - require_intl_args_match: true  # [ERROR] The placeholders in your Intl.message string do not match the arguments provided in the args list. Missing, extra, or mismatched arguments cause runtime errors, broken translations, and can result in untranslated or incorrect messages in production. This is a common source of i18n bugs and can break localization workflows.
    - require_intl_plural_rules: true  # [WARNING] Manual pluralization logic using if/else or ternary expressions on count values. Languages such as Russian, Arabic, and Polish have complex plural categories (zero, one, two, few, many, other) that simple singular/plural branching cannot handle. This produces grammatically incorrect text for international users and breaks translation workflows.
    - require_ios_app_tracking_transparency: true  # [ERROR] Advertising/tracking SDK detected. iOS 14.5+ requires App Tracking Transparency permission before tracking users.

    - require_ios_privacy_manifest: true  # [WARNING] API requires an iOS Privacy Manifest entry (iOS 17+). Missing PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy declarations for required-reason APIs will cause automatic App Store rejection during review, block new releases, and may trigger runtime permission failures on user devices.
    - require_ios_receipt_validation: true  # [WARNING] In-app purchase detected. Ensure receipt is validated with server, not just locally.
    - require_key_for_reorderable: true  # [ERROR] Without unique keys, reordering fails silently or shows wrong items after drag-and-drop.
    - require_late_initialization_in_init_state: true  # [WARNING] Late field initialized in build() recreates the object on every setState() call. AnimationController instances restart their animations, StreamSubscription objects create duplicate listeners, and the resulting UI jank becomes visible to users. This also wastes memory by allocating new objects on every widget rebuild cycle.
    - require_lifecycle_observer: true  # [WARNING] Long-running timers, streams, or background tasks must be paused or stopped when the app is backgrounded. Failing to observe lifecycle changes can drain battery, consume CPU, and cause stale callbacks to execute when the app resumes, leading to inconsistent state and poor user experience. This may also violate platform guidelines and result in app store rejection.
    - require_location_permission_rationale: true  # [WARNING] Location permission requested without showing rationale. Users may deny without understanding why.
    - require_macos_notarization_ready: true  # [INFO] macOS app detected. Ensure notarization is configured for distribution. Apps without notarization show security warnings.
    - require_map_idle_callback: true  # [INFO] Data fetching triggered in onCameraMove fires on every frame during map pan and zoom gestures. This spams backend APIs with hundreds of redundant requests per second, causes severe performance degradation with UI jank, and wastes user bandwidth and battery on mobile devices.
    - require_media_loading_state: true  # [INFO] VideoPlayer displayed without checking isInitialized shows a black rectangle or crashes. The video player needs time to load the video before the build method can render it properly.
    - require_media_player_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Undisposed media controller holds audio/video hardware, blocking other apps and draining battery. This can cause resource leaks, app crashes, and poor user experience.
    - require_method_channel_error_handling: true  # [WARNING] MethodChannel.invokeMethod without error handling may crash on iOS/macOS.
    - require_minimum_contrast: true  # [WARNING] Low contrast text excludes users with low vision, cataracts, or age-related sight loss who cannot distinguish foreground from background. WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Failing to meet this threshold makes content unreadable for millions of users worldwide.
    - require_mock_http_client: true  # [WARNING] Real HTTP calls in tests create network dependencies that cause flaky failures and slow CI pipelines. Tests become non-deterministic, failing on timeout when servers are slow and passing inconsistently across environments, making test results unreliable for merge decisions.
    - require_mounted_check: true  # [ERROR] Calling setState after an await without checking if the StatefulWidget is still mounted in the widget tree throws a "setState called after dispose" error. This leads to runtime exceptions, app instability, and hard-to-debug crashes, especially in async code.
    - require_mounted_check_after_await: true  # [ERROR] setState called after await without mounted check. Widget may have been disposed.
    - require_native_resource_cleanup: true  # [WARNING] Unfreed native memory leaks outside Dart GC, causing permanent memory loss until app restart.

    - require_page_controller_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Not disposing of a PageController when a widget is removed from the tree can cause memory leaks and continued resource usage, leading to performance issues and potential crashes in long-running apps. This is especially critical in apps with dynamic navigation or frequent page changes. See https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PageController/dispose.html.
    - require_provider_dispose: true  # [WARNING] Provider creating a ChangeNotifier without a dispose callback leaks listener registrations and memory. Over time, leaked notifiers accumulate stale listeners that fire after the StatefulWidget is removed from the tree, causing setState-after-dispose errors and increasing memory pressure.
    - require_provider_scope: true  # [ERROR] If your Riverpod app is missing ProviderScope at the root, any attempt to access providers will throw runtime exceptions and crash the app. This makes the app unusable and breaks all provider-based state management.
    - require_purchase_restoration: true  # [ERROR] In-app purchase detected without restore functionality. App Store requires "Restore Purchases" for non-consumables.
    - require_purchase_verification: true  # [ERROR] In-app purchase without server verification detected. Client-side verification can be bypassed by attackers.
    - require_qr_content_validation: true  # [WARNING] QR code scan result used without validation creates a security vulnerability. Malicious QR codes can contain crafted URLs that redirect to phishing sites, inject JavaScript through URL schemes, trigger automatic downloads, or launch unintended app actions. Users scanning codes in public places are especially vulnerable.
    - require_qr_permission_check: true  # [ERROR] If you open the QR scanner without first requesting camera permission, your app will show a black screen on iOS or crash on some Android devices. This breaks user experience and can cause app store rejection.
    - require_riverpod_error_handling: true  # [WARNING] AsyncValue from a Riverpod provider accessed without handling error and loading states. When the async operation fails or is in progress, accessing .value directly throws a StateError or returns null, causing crashes or displaying stale data. Users see broken UI instead of loading indicators or error messages.
    - require_route_guards: true  # [WARNING] Protected route path (profile, settings, admin, payment) lacks an authentication guard. Without a redirect callback, unauthorized users can access sensitive pages directly via deep link or URL manipulation, exposing personal data, financial information, or admin controls to unauthenticated sessions.
    - require_scroll_controller_dispose: true  # [ERROR] ScrollController is not disposed. This causes memory leaks.
    - require_search_debounce: true  # [WARNING] Calling a search API on every keystroke can overwhelm your backend, degrade performance, and create a poor user experience. Without debouncing, users may see lag, rate limits, or unnecessary network traffic.
    - require_secure_password_field: true  # [WARNING] Password input fields must disable suggestions and autocorrect to prevent sensitive information from being stored in device dictionaries or suggested to users inappropriately. Failing to do so increases the risk of password leakage, accidental exposure, and poor user privacy. Always configure password fields to maximize security and user trust.
    - require_secure_storage_for_auth: true  # [ERROR] Auth tokens in SharedPreferences leak via backup extraction, enabling account takeover.
    - require_speech_stop_on_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Unreleased SpeechToText keeps microphone active, draining battery and blocking other apps.

    - require_sse_subscription_cancel: true  # [ERROR] If a widget (such as a StatefulWidget managing a live data feed) opens a Server-Sent Events (SSE) or EventSource connection but does not cancel it in dispose(), the connection remains open after the widget is removed. This can result in orphaned network connections, wasted bandwidth, and memory leaks, especially in dashboards, chat clients, or any UI with dynamic SSE usage. Always close SSE/EventSource connections in the correct State object’s dispose() method. See https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/memory#dispose-resources.
    - require_stepper_validation: true  # [INFO] Stepper onStepContinue callback does not validate form input before proceeding. This can allow users to advance with incomplete or invalid data, leading to errors or inconsistent state.
    - require_stream_controller_close: true  # [ERROR] Failing to close a StreamController in the dispose() method leaves the stream open, causing memory leaks, connection handle exhaustion, and potential app crashes. Unclosed streams can accumulate events and listeners, degrading performance and making debugging difficult. Proper closure is essential for robust, production-quality Flutter apps.
    - require_stream_controller_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Not closing a StreamController in the StatefulWidget dispose method will leak memory, keep listeners active, and cause app slowdowns, crashes, or persistent background activity. This leads to stream subscription exhaustion, battery drain, and unpredictable bugs, especially in production apps with frequent widget tree rebuilds. Unclosed controllers also prevent garbage collection and block app updates.
    - require_stream_subscription_cancel: true  # [WARNING] StreamSubscription field without cancel(). Callbacks fire after State disposal, causing setState errors and memory leaks.
    - require_subscription_status_check: true  # [WARNING] Premium/subscription content displayed without status verification. Subscription may have expired.
    - require_supabase_realtime_unsubscribe: true  # [ERROR] Unsubscribed channel keeps WebSocket open, leaking connections and receiving stale updates.
    - require_tab_controller_dispose: true  # [ERROR] Undisposed TabController leaks AnimationController, causing memory exhaustion over time.
    - require_tab_controller_length_sync: true  # [ERROR] TabController length mismatch throws RangeError when switching tabs, crashing the app.
    - require_test_widget_pump: true  # [ERROR] After simulating a tap or text entry in a widget test, failing to call pump() or pumpAndSettle() means the widget tree will not rebuild, so your test may pass even though the user experience is broken. Always process pending build events to ensure your test reflects real app behavior.
    - require_text_editing_controller_dispose: true  # [ERROR] When a State class creates a TextEditingController for a TextField, search bar, or form input and fails to dispose of it in dispose(), the controller’s internal listeners and text buffers will persist after the widget is removed from the widget tree. This can cause memory leaks, input lag, and unpredictable or stale text field behavior, especially in dynamic forms, chat UIs, or lists where widgets are frequently created and destroyed. In severe cases, this can lead to app slowdowns or crashes due to uncollected resources. Always dispose of every TextEditingController in the owning State object’s dispose() method to ensure proper cleanup. See: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/TextEditingController-class.html
    - require_type_adapter_registration: true  # [WARNING] Hive box opened with a custom type but the corresponding TypeAdapter may not be registered. Unregistered adapters cause HiveError at runtime, preventing all read and write operations on the box, which leads to app crashes and complete data inaccessibility.
    - require_unique_iv_per_encryption: true  # [ERROR] Using a static or reused initialization vector (IV) with the same encryption key enables attackers to detect patterns in your encrypted data. When the same IV is used for multiple encryption operations, identical plaintexts will always produce identical ciphertexts, making it possible for adversaries to infer relationships between messages, perform replay attacks, or even recover plaintexts in some encryption modes. This breaks the fundamental guarantee of confidentiality provided by encryption and has led to serious vulnerabilities in real-world systems.
    - require_unknown_route_handler: true  # [WARNING] MaterialApp or CupertinoApp defines routes or onGenerateRoute but does not provide an onUnknownRoute handler. When a user navigates to an undefined route path via deep link, push notification, or programmatic navigation, the app throws an unhandled exception and crashes instead of showing a helpful error screen.
    - require_url_validation: true  # [WARNING] Uri.parse on user input without scheme validation enables SSRF attacks. Attackers can make your app connect to internal servers, databases, or use malicious protocols to exfiltrate data.
    - require_value_notifier_dispose: true  # [ERROR] If you do not dispose a ValueNotifier, it will leak memory, keep listeners attached, and trigger updates on a StatefulWidget that has already been removed from the widget tree. This causes memory leaks, unexpected UI updates, and hard-to-find bugs in your app.
    - require_vsync_mixin: true  # [ERROR] AnimationController is missing a vsync parameter. Without vsync, animations run without frame synchronization, causing visual tearing, wasted CPU cycles, and degraded user experience. This can lead to janky motion and battery drain, especially on mobile devices. Always provide vsync: this and mix in SingleTickerProviderStateMixin to ensure smooth, efficient animations and proper animation controller lifecycle management.
    - require_websocket_close: true  # [WARNING] Unclosed WebSocket leaks connections and continues receiving data after widget disposal, causing errors.
    - require_websocket_message_validation: true  # [WARNING] Unvalidated WebSocket messages crash when malformed data arrives, or enable injection attacks.
    - require_websocket_reconnection: true  # [WARNING] WebSocket connection without reconnection logic will stay permanently disconnected after network interruptions, server restarts, or mobile network handoffs. Users will see stale data, miss real-time updates, and have no indication that the live connection has dropped until they manually refresh or restart the app.
    - require_webview_ssl_error_handling: true  # [ERROR] If your WebView does not handle SSL certificate errors, it may silently accept invalid or malicious certificates, exposing users to man-in-the-middle attacks. Users may unknowingly submit sensitive information (such as passwords or payment details) to attackers, resulting in account compromise, data theft, or financial loss. Proper SSL error handling is essential for secure in-app browsing.
    - require_workmanager_result_return: true  # [ERROR] Missing return value makes WorkManager assume failure, triggering unnecessary retries.
    - use_ref_and_state_synchronously: true  # [WARNING] Using ref after await risks accessing disposed provider, causing runtime errors or stale data.

    #
    - avoid_accessing_collections_by_constant_index: true  # [WARNING] Accessing collection by constant index inside loop.
    - avoid_analytics_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Analytics calls inside build() are triggered on every rebuild, resulting in duplicate events, inaccurate tracking data, degraded app performance, and inflated backend costs. This can skew business metrics, produce misleading dashboards, and make it difficult to analyze real user behavior. Persistent analytics spam may also trigger rate limits or data quality flags in analytics platforms.
    - avoid_animation_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Creating an AnimationController inside the build() method causes a new controller to be instantiated on every widget rebuild, leading to severe memory leaks, degraded animation performance, and unpredictable UI behavior. Previous controllers are never disposed, which can crash your app or exhaust system resources. AnimationControllers must be long-lived and managed at the widget level, not recreated per frame. This is a critical resource management issue in Flutter.
    - avoid_assigning_to_static_field: true  # [WARNING] Instance method should not modify static field.
    - avoid_assignments_as_conditions: true  # [WARNING] Assignment in condition. Likely meant == comparison, not = assignment.

    - avoid_bitwise_operators_with_booleans: true  # [WARNING] Bitwise operator on boolean. Unlike &&/||, this does not short-circuit.
    - avoid_bloc_business_logic_in_ui: true  # [WARNING] UI code such as showDialog or Navigator calls inside a Bloc breaks separation of concerns and makes the Bloc untestable without a widget tree. Business logic becomes coupled to the UI framework, preventing reuse across platforms and complicating unit testing.
    - avoid_bloc_emit_after_close: true  # [ERROR] Calling emit() after an await may throw an exception if the Bloc has been closed, leading to runtime errors and unpredictable state changes. This can cause crashes or silent failures, especially in asynchronous event handlers. Always check that the Bloc is still open before emitting new states after an await.
    - avoid_bloc_event_in_constructor: true  # [ERROR] Adding a BLoC event in the constructor runs it before listeners are attached, causing missed state updates and unpredictable app behavior. This can result in lost events, bugs that are hard to trace, and inconsistent UI state.
    - avoid_bloc_in_bloc: true  # [WARNING] BLoC directly calling another BLoC creates tight coupling between state managers. This makes unit testing difficult, risks circular dependencies, and breaks the unidirectional data flow pattern that BLoC relies on for predictable state management.
    - avoid_bloc_listen_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Using BlocProvider.of in build() with listen:true causes the widget to rebuild on every state change, leading to performance issues and unpredictable UI updates. This can make your app less efficient and harder to maintain.
    - avoid_bloc_public_fields: true  # [WARNING] Public field in Bloc. Keep internals private.
    - avoid_bloc_state_mutation: true  # [ERROR] Direct mutation bypasses equality checks, preventing UI rebuild and causing stale data display.
    - avoid_blocking_database_ui: true  # [WARNING] Database operation executed in build() or on the main UI thread blocks rendering until the query completes. Users experience frozen screens, unresponsive touch input, and dropped animation frames. Long-running queries can trigger ANR dialogs on Android and watchdog termination on iOS.
    - avoid_bluetooth_scan_without_timeout: true  # [WARNING] Infinite Bluetooth scan drains battery and may run until app termination.
    - avoid_bottom_type_in_patterns: true  # [WARNING] Pattern uses a bottom type (void, Never, or Null) that either never matches any value or only matches null. This creates dead code in switch cases and if-case expressions, silently hiding logic errors.
    - avoid_bottom_type_in_records: true  # [WARNING] Record field uses void/Never/Null which cannot hold useful values.
    - avoid_build_context_in_providers: true  # [WARNING] Storing BuildContext in providers can cause memory leaks.
    - avoid_canvas_operations_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Canvas operations (drawing, painting) should only be performed in CustomPainter.paint(), not in build() or other widget methods. Doing this in build() can cause severe performance issues, unpredictable rendering, visual glitches, and broken platform optimizations. This may result in app store rejection for poor graphics handling and negative user feedback due to laggy or broken UI.
    - avoid_cascade_after_if_null: true  # [WARNING] Cascade after ?? may have unexpected precedence.
    - avoid_casting_to_extension_type: true  # [WARNING] Avoid casting to extension types.
    - avoid_catching_generic_exception: true  # [INFO] Avoid catching generic exceptions.
    - avoid_change_notifier_in_widget: true  # [WARNING] ChangeNotifier created inside build() is re-instantiated on every widget rebuild, losing all accumulated state and listener registrations. This causes flickering UI, lost user input, and wasted allocations that trigger unnecessary garbage collection.
    - avoid_closure_memory_leak: true  # [WARNING] Closure capturing setState retains a strong reference to the State object, preventing garbage collection after the widget is disposed. The entire parent widget subtree leaks memory, and calling setState on an unmounted widget throws a framework error that crashes the app during subsequent navigation.
    - avoid_collection_equality_checks: true  # [WARNING] Comparing collections with == uses reference equality. This can cause false positives/negatives, leading to logic errors and unexpected app behavior.
    - avoid_collection_methods_with_unrelated_types: true  # [WARNING] Collection method called with unrelated type.
    - avoid_color_only_indicators: true  # [WARNING] Color-only status indicator fails for approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women who have color vision deficiency and cannot distinguish red from green, making the UI completely inaccessible to colorblind users. Relying solely on color to convey meaning violates WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of Color), which requires a secondary visual cue such as an icon, text label, or pattern to communicate status information.
    - avoid_conditions_with_boolean_literals: true  # [INFO] Avoid using boolean literals in logical expressions.
    - avoid_constant_assert_conditions: true  # [WARNING] Assert has a constant condition that is always {0}.

    - avoid_contradictory_expressions: true  # [WARNING] Contradictory conditions detected.
    - avoid_controller_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Creating controllers (e.g., TextEditingController, AnimationController) inside the build() method causes a new instance to be created on every rebuild. This leads to memory leaks, lost state, and degraded performance, as old controllers are never disposed.
    - avoid_creating_vector_in_update: true  # [WARNING] Creating new Vector objects (Vector2, Vector3, etc.) inside update() causes frequent garbage collection (GC) churn every frame, leading to performance degradation, frame drops, and increased CPU usage. In real-time games, this can cause stuttering, input lag, and poor user experience, especially on lower-end devices.
    - avoid_database_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Running database queries inside build() causes the query to execute on every rebuild, leading to repeated database hits, slow UI, increased backend load, and degraded app performance. This can also cause inconsistent data, race conditions, and higher costs for cloud databases.
    - avoid_datetime_parse_unvalidated: true  # [WARNING] DateTime.parse throws on invalid input. Unvalidated parsing can crash the app, cause silent failures, and break data flows. This is a common source of bugs in date handling and can lead to missed events or corrupted records.
    - avoid_debug_print: true  # [WARNING] Avoid using debugPrint. Use a proper logging solution instead.
    - avoid_deep_widget_nesting: true  # [INFO] Widget tree exceeds 15 levels of nesting.
    - avoid_deeply_nested_widgets: true  # [INFO] Widget tree is too deeply nested.
    - avoid_di_in_widgets: true  # [WARNING] Avoid GetIt.I in widgets. Use Provider or InheritedWidget for dependency injection in UI.
    - avoid_double_slash_imports: true  # [WARNING] Import path contains double slashes. Double slashes in import paths cause resolution failures on some platforms and may silently import the wrong file, leading to runtime errors or missing symbols.
    - avoid_double_tap_submit: true  # [WARNING] Button may allow double-tap submissions.
    - avoid_duplicate_exports: true  # [WARNING] File is exported multiple times. Duplicate exports increase compilation time, confuse IDE auto-imports, and may cause unexpected symbol visibility when show/hide combinators differ between duplicates.
    - avoid_duplicate_mixins: true  # [WARNING] Mixin is applied multiple times in the same class declaration. Duplicate mixin applications have no additional effect and indicate a copy-paste error or misunderstanding of the class hierarchy.
    - avoid_duplicate_named_imports: true  # [WARNING] Import is declared multiple times with different prefixes. Multiple imports of the same URI with different prefixes create ambiguity about which prefix to use, increase cognitive load, and may cause IDE auto-import confusion.
    - avoid_duplicate_number_elements: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate numeric element in collection literal typically indicates a copy-paste error or logic mistake. In Sets, the duplicate is silently ignored, producing a smaller collection than expected.
    - avoid_duplicate_object_elements: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate object reference or literal (bool, null, identifier) in collection typically indicates a copy-paste error. In Sets, the duplicate is silently ignored, producing a smaller collection than expected.
    - avoid_duplicate_patterns: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate pattern detected.
    - avoid_duplicate_string_elements: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate string element in collection literal typically indicates a copy-paste error or incomplete refactoring. In Sets, the duplicate is silently ignored, producing a smaller collection than expected.
    - avoid_duplicate_switch_case_conditions: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate switch case condition detected.
    - avoid_dynamic_json_chains: true  # [ERROR] Deep dynamic access throws NoSuchMethodError or TypeError at runtime when any nested key is missing. Chaining multiple dynamic map accesses (e.g., json["a"]["b"]["c"]) is fragile and will crash if any key is missing or null. This leads to runtime exceptions, broken features, and poor user experience. Always check each level for null before accessing the next.
    - avoid_empty_build_when: true  # [WARNING] buildWhen always returns true, defeating optimization.
    - avoid_empty_setstate: true  # [WARNING] Empty setState callback has no effect.
    - avoid_empty_spread: true  # [WARNING] Empty spread operator (...[] or ...{}) adds nothing to your collection and may confuse readers. This is often a leftover from refactoring or copy-paste and serves no purpose.
    - avoid_empty_test_groups: true  # [WARNING] Test group has an empty body.
    - avoid_empty_text_widgets: true  # [INFO] Avoid using Text widget with empty string.
    - avoid_enum_values_by_index: true  # [WARNING] Avoid accessing enum values by index.
    - avoid_equal_expressions: true  # [WARNING] Both sides of the binary expression are identical, meaning the comparison always produces the same result (true for ==, false for >, <). This is almost always a copy-paste bug where the developer intended to compare two different values, and the redundant comparison masks the real logic error in the code.
    - avoid_exception_in_constructor: true  # [WARNING] Throwing in a constructor creates a partially constructed object that can leak resources and leave dependent fields uninitialized. Callers cannot easily recover because the constructor has already failed midway through initialization.
    - avoid_expensive_build: true  # [WARNING] Expensive operations in build() run on every frame, causing jank and dropped frames during animations.
    - avoid_find_child_in_build: true  # [INFO] findChildIndexCallback should not be created in build.
    - avoid_firestore_in_widget_build: true  # [WARNING] Performing Firestore operations (get, collection, doc) inside build() causes the query to run on every rebuild, leading to excessive database reads, slow UI, increased backend costs, and potential quota exhaustion. This can also cause inconsistent data, race conditions, and degraded user experience, especially in dynamic UIs.
    - avoid_firestore_unbounded_query: true  # [WARNING] Firestore query without limit() returns unbounded data from the entire collection. This triggers excessive bandwidth consumption, inflated Firestore read costs, slow UI rendering, and out-of-memory crashes on low-end devices when the collection grows large.
    - avoid_flaky_tests: true  # [WARNING] Test contains patterns that may cause flakiness.
    - avoid_form_without_key: true  # [WARNING] Form widget should have a GlobalKey for validation.
    - avoid_freezed_json_serializable_conflict: true  # [ERROR] Combining Freezed and json_serializable annotations incorrectly can result in code generation conflicts, leading to broken serialization, runtime errors, or data loss. This can cause your app to fail when parsing or serializing JSON, especially in production environments. Always follow the recommended integration patterns to ensure reliable code generation. See https://pub.dev/packages/freezed#json_serializable.
    - avoid_future_ignore: true  # [WARNING] Calling Future.ignore() discards all errors and exceptions from the Future, causing failures to go unnoticed. This can result in silent bugs, missed exceptions, and unreliable app behavior, especially in production where error reporting is critical.
    - avoid_future_then_in_async: true  # [INFO] Using .then() inside async function. Prefer await for consistency.
    - avoid_future_tostring: true  # [WARNING] Future.toString() returns 'Instance of Future', not the resolved value. Logs show useless output, error messages fail to include actual data, and debugging async code becomes nearly impossible.
    - avoid_generic_exceptions: true  # [INFO] Generic Exception thrown instead of a specific error type. This prevents callers from distinguishing between different failure modes, forces broad catch-all blocks, and makes error traceability across services impossible. Specific exception types enable targeted recovery and clearer crash reports.
    - avoid_generic_key_in_url: true  # [WARNING] Sensitive data embedded in URL query parameters is logged by web servers, proxy caches, browser history, and analytics tools. This exposes API keys, tokens, and credentials in access logs and referrer headers, where they persist indefinitely and can be harvested by attackers with log access.
    - avoid_gesture_conflict: true  # [WARNING] Nested GestureDetector widgets may cause gesture conflicts.
    - avoid_gesture_only_interactions: true  # [WARNING] GestureDetector is used without providing keyboard or accessibility support, making the interaction inaccessible to users with motor disabilities or those relying on switch control. This excludes users who cannot use touch input and fails to meet accessibility standards for interactive elements.
    - avoid_gesture_without_behavior: true  # [INFO] GestureDetector should specify HitTestBehavior.
    - avoid_getx_dialog_snackbar_in_controller: true  # [WARNING] Get.snackbar/dialog in controller couples UI to business logic and prevents testing.
    - avoid_global_keys_in_state: true  # [WARNING] GlobalKey in StatefulWidget persists across hot reload. Move to State class instead.
    - avoid_global_state: true  # [WARNING] Mutable global state detected. Top-level mutable variables create hidden dependencies between functions, make unit testing unreliable because tests share state, and cause race conditions in concurrent or isolate-based code.
    - avoid_go_router_push_replacement_confusion: true  # [INFO] context.go() used to navigate to a detail route with a dynamic ID parameter. go() replaces the entire navigation stack, destroying the back button history and preventing users from returning to the previous screen.
    - avoid_gradient_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Creating Gradient in build() prevents reuse and causes allocations. This leads to unnecessary memory usage, slower UI performance, and increased battery drain.
    - avoid_hardcoded_api_urls: true  # [WARNING] Hardcoded API URLs prevent switching between development, staging, and production environments, making code inflexible and error-prone. This practice also risks leaking sensitive endpoints and complicates maintenance. Always extract API URLs to configuration constants (e.g., ApiConfig.baseUrl) to enable environment switching and improve security.
    - avoid_hardcoded_layout_values: true  # [INFO] Avoid hardcoded numeric values in layout widgets.
    - avoid_hardcoded_signing_config: true  # [WARNING] Hardcoding keystore paths, passwords, or signing configuration in source code exposes them to reverse engineering. These values are extractable from compiled binaries and enable attackers to sign malicious builds.
    - avoid_hardcoded_test_delays: true  # [WARNING] Test has hardcoded delay which makes tests slow and flaky.
    - avoid_hardcoded_text_styles: true  # [INFO] Avoid inline TextStyle with hardcoded values.

    - avoid_hive_box_name_collision: true  # [WARNING] Generic Hive box name may cause collision. Use a specific name.
    - avoid_hover_only: true  # [WARNING] Interactive elements respond only to hover events, excluding mobile and touch users as well as people with motor disabilities. All actionable child elements in the widget tree must support both pointer and touch interactions for universal accessibility.
    - avoid_icon_buttons_without_tooltip: true  # [WARNING] This IconButton does not provide a tooltip, making it inaccessible to screen readers and users with visual impairments. Without a tooltip, users cannot understand the button’s purpose, which reduces usability and fails accessibility standards. Tooltips are essential for describing the action of icon-only buttons.
    - avoid_image_buttons_without_tooltip: true  # [WARNING] This image-only button does not provide an accessible label, making it invisible to screen readers and users with visual impairments. Without a tooltip or semantic label, users cannot understand or interact with the button, which fails accessibility standards and excludes blind users from key actions.
    - avoid_implicitly_nullable_extension_types: true  # [WARNING] Extension type is implicitly nullable.
    - avoid_incorrect_image_opacity: true  # [WARNING] Wrapping an Image widget in an Opacity widget is inefficient and can cause performance issues, as it requires the image to be composited offscreen. Instead, use the Image widget’s color and colorBlendMode properties to achieve opacity effects directly, which is more performant and recommended by Flutter best practices.
    - avoid_incorrect_uri: true  # [WARNING] URI string appears to be malformed.
    - avoid_ios_13_deprecations: true  # [WARNING] Deprecated iOS API detected. This API is deprecated since iOS 13 and may cause App Store rejection.

    - avoid_json_encode_in_build: true  # [WARNING] jsonEncode in build() is expensive and causes jank.
    - avoid_jwt_decode_client: true  # [WARNING] Decoding JWT tokens on the client for authorization decisions is insecure because the client cannot verify token signatures. Attackers can craft or modify JWT claims to bypass permission checks, escalate privileges, and access restricted features or data without valid server-issued credentials.
    - avoid_keywords_in_wildcard_pattern: true  # [WARNING] Pattern variable uses a Dart keyword.
    - avoid_large_images_in_memory: true  # [INFO] Image should specify size constraints to save memory.
    - avoid_large_list_copy: true  # [INFO] List.from() and toList() allocate a new list and copy every element, doubling memory consumption for the duration of the operation. For large collections, this triggers garbage collection pauses that freeze the UI and degrade scrolling performance. The unnecessary allocation pressure accumulates rapidly in loops or frequently called methods.
    - avoid_late_context: true  # [WARNING] Avoid using BuildContext in late field initializers.
    - avoid_late_for_nullable: true  # [INFO] Avoid using late for nullable types. Use nullable without late instead.
    - avoid_layout_builder_in_scrollable: true  # [WARNING] LayoutBuilder inside scrollable causes performance issues.
    - avoid_listview_children_for_large_lists: true  # [WARNING] ListView with many children loads all items. Use ListView.builder.

    - avoid_manual_date_formatting: true  # [WARNING] Manual date formatting is error-prone, ignores locale, and can produce incorrect or confusing output for international users. This can break compliance, cause user confusion, and lead to support issues in global apps.
    - avoid_map_keys_contains: true  # [INFO] Calling .keys.contains() allocates an iterable of all keys and performs a linear search, while .containsKey() uses the map hash table for O(1) lookup. This wastes memory and CPU cycles on every call.
    - avoid_map_markers_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Creating map markers in build() causes flickering.
    - avoid_material2_fallback: true  # [INFO] Avoid explicitly disabling Material 3.
    - avoid_mediaquery_in_build: true  # [INFO] Use specific MediaQuery methods instead of MediaQuery.of.
    - avoid_memory_intensive_operations: true  # [WARNING] String concatenation using += inside a loop creates a new String object on every iteration, resulting in O(n squared) memory allocations. Each iteration copies the entire accumulated string, causing excessive garbage collection pressure, UI thread pauses, and visible jank in animations or scrolling.
    - avoid_misnamed_padding: true  # [INFO] A parameter or field named "padding" is being used to provide margin (spacing outside a widget) rather than actual padding (spacing inside a widget). This can confuse maintainers and lead to incorrect UI adjustments, as padding and margin serve distinct layout purposes in Flutter.
    - avoid_missing_completer_stack_trace: true  # [WARNING] completeError() called without stack trace.
    - avoid_missing_enum_constant_in_map: true  # [INFO] Map may be missing enum constant keys.

    - avoid_money_arithmetic_on_double: true  # [WARNING] Floating point arithmetic on double values introduces rounding errors in financial calculations. For example, 0.1 + 0.2 yields 0.30000000000000004 instead of 0.3. This causes users to see incorrect totals, be charged wrong amounts, and produces accounting discrepancies that compound over multiple transactions and are difficult to trace.
    - avoid_motion_without_reduce: true  # [INFO] Animation should respect disableAnimations preference.
    - avoid_multiple_autofocus: true  # [WARNING] Multiple widgets with autofocus: true causes unpredictable behavior.
    - avoid_multiple_stream_listeners: true  # [WARNING] Multiple listen() calls detected on the same non-broadcast stream. Single-subscription streams only allow one active listener at a time. Adding a second listener throws a StateError at runtime, which crashes your app and makes the stream connection unusable for all subscribers.
    - avoid_navigation_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Navigation in build() triggers during rebuild, causing infinite navigation loops or flickering screens.
    - avoid_navigator_context_issue: true  # [ERROR] Using context from GlobalKey for navigation can fail if widget is not in tree.
    - avoid_navigator_push_unnamed: true  # [INFO] Navigator.push used with an inline route constructor instead of a named route. Inline routes prevent deep linking, break URL-based navigation, and make route management unmaintainable. Users cannot share or bookmark specific screens, and analytics tools cannot track page views accurately.
    - avoid_nested_assignments: true  # [WARNING] Avoid using assignment inside another expression.
    - avoid_nested_providers: true  # [WARNING] Provider created inside Consumer or builder callback.
    - avoid_nested_routes_without_parent: true  # [WARNING] context.go() navigates to a path with 3+ segments, which places users deep in the route hierarchy without parent routes on the stack. The back button skips intermediate screens, breaking expected navigation flow and disorienting users.

    - avoid_passing_async_when_sync_expected: true  # [WARNING] Async callback passed to a sync-only method such as forEach, map, or where. The returned Future is silently discarded, which means any errors thrown inside the callback are lost and never reported. This makes debugging extremely difficult and can hide critical failures in your application logic.
    - avoid_passing_bloc_to_bloc: true  # [WARNING] Bloc should not depend on another Bloc. This creates tight coupling and makes testing difficult.
    - avoid_passing_build_context_to_blocs: true  # [WARNING] BuildContext in Bloc couples UI to business logic and makes testing difficult.
    - avoid_prefs_for_large_data: true  # [WARNING] SharedPreferences loads its entire file into memory on first access, making it unsuitable for large datasets. Storing collections or large JSON blobs here causes slow app startup, excessive memory consumption, UI freezes, and potential data corruption on write failures.
    - avoid_provider_in_widget: true  # [ERROR] Declaring a provider inside a widget class breaks Riverpod's global state model, leading to multiple provider instances, lost state, and unpredictable bugs. This can make your app behave inconsistently and is hard to debug.
    - avoid_provider_recreate: true  # [ERROR] Creating a Provider inside a frequently rebuilding build() method causes the provider to be recreated, losing its state and causing unexpected behavior. This can result in lost user input, bugs, and degraded app performance.

    - avoid_real_timer_in_widget_test: true  # [WARNING] Avoid using Timer in widget tests.
    - avoid_rebuild_on_scroll: true  # [WARNING] Scroll listener registered inside build() is re-added on every widget rebuild without removing the previous one. Duplicate listeners accumulate over time, firing multiple callbacks per scroll event, causing memory leaks, compounding performance degradation, and eventually crashes from excessive callback execution.
    - avoid_redundant_async: true  # [INFO] Declaring a function async without using await adds unnecessary Future wrapping and microtask scheduling overhead. This can make code harder to read, debug, and maintain, and may introduce subtle timing bugs.
    - avoid_redundant_async_on_load: true  # [INFO] async onLoad() without await adds unnecessary overhead.
    - avoid_referencing_discarded_variables: true  # [WARNING] Avoid referencing variables marked as discarded.
    - avoid_refresh_without_await: true  # [WARNING] RefreshIndicator onRefresh callback must return a Future that completes when data loading finishes. Without awaiting async operations, the refresh spinner dismisses immediately while data is still loading, leaving users confused about whether the refresh succeeded or failed and showing stale content.
    - avoid_regex_in_loop: true  # [WARNING] RegExp created inside loop. Move it outside for efficiency.
    - avoid_returning_value_from_cubit_methods: true  # [INFO] Cubit methods should emit states, not return values. This bypasses reactive state management.
    - avoid_riverpod_notifier_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Creating a Riverpod Notifier inside the build method reinstantiates it on every widget rebuild, discarding all accumulated state. Users experience lost form input, reset scroll positions, and flickering UI as the notifier repeatedly initializes from scratch.
    - avoid_scaffold_messenger_after_await: true  # [WARNING] Using ScaffoldMessenger.of(context) after await may use an invalid context.
    - avoid_screenshot_sensitive: true  # [INFO] Sensitive screen allows screenshots and screen recording.
    - avoid_secure_storage_on_web: true  # [WARNING] flutter_secure_storage uses localStorage on web, which is not secure. Sensitive data stored in localStorage may be exposed to attackers, browser extensions, or other scripts, violating user privacy and security requirements. This can lead to credential theft, data breaches, and app store rejection.
    - avoid_self_assignment: true  # [WARNING] Variable is assigned to itself (x = x), which has no effect and indicates a copy-paste error or incomplete refactor. The assignment executes at runtime but produces no state change, wasting CPU cycles and obscuring the developer's actual intent. This dead code makes maintenance harder because readers must determine whether the assignment was intentional.
    - avoid_self_compare: true  # [WARNING] Variable is compared to itself (x == x, x > x, etc.), which always produces a constant result (true for ==, false for inequality operators) unless the value is NaN. This is almost always a copy-paste bug where the developer intended to compare two distinct values, and the redundant comparison hides the real logic error in the code.
    - avoid_semantics_exclusion: true  # [WARNING] excludeFromSemantics: true detected without accompanying documentation. Screen reader users will encounter hidden content without understanding why it was excluded, making it difficult to debug accessibility issues or verify the exclusion was intentional.
    - avoid_set_state_in_dispose: true  # [ERROR] setState in dispose() throws "setState called after dispose" error, crashing the app during navigation.
    - avoid_shadowed_extension_methods: true  # [WARNING] Extension method shadows class method.
    - avoid_shrink_wrap_in_lists: true  # [WARNING] Using 'shrinkWrap: true' inside a nested scrollable (such as a ListView within another scrollable) can cause significant performance issues. It forces the inner list to compute the size of all its children, leading to poor scroll performance and increased memory usage, especially with large or dynamic lists.
    - avoid_shrink_wrap_in_scroll: true  # [WARNING] shrinkWrap: true causes O(n) layout cost and defeats lazy loading.
    - avoid_shrinkwrap_in_scrollview: true  # [WARNING] shrinkWrap: true on a scrollable list disables virtualization, forcing Flutter to lay out and render every child widget immediately regardless of visibility. This causes severe jank, high memory usage, and slow initial rendering for lists with more than a few dozen items, degrading the user experience.
    - avoid_single_child_column_row: true  # [INFO] Column/Row with single child is unnecessary.
    - avoid_singlechildscrollview_with_column: true  # [WARNING] SingleChildScrollView with Column may cause layout issues.
    - avoid_small_touch_targets: true  # [INFO] Touch target under 44px violates WCAG 2.5.5 (Target Size). Users with motor impairments, tremors, or limited dexterity will struggle to tap accurately, causing frustration and excluding them from core functionality. The minimum recommended touch target size is 48x48 logical pixels to ensure reliable interaction across all ability levels.
    - avoid_snackbar_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Calling showSnackBar inside build() causes a snackbar to be shown on every rebuild, flooding the user with duplicate messages and overwhelming the snackbar queue. This leads to poor user experience, lost context, and can make the app feel buggy or unresponsive. It may also result in app store rejection for UX violations and negative user reviews due to notification spam.
    - avoid_stack_without_positioned: true  # [WARNING] Stack child without Positioned. Layout may be unexpected.
    - avoid_state_constructors: true  # [WARNING] State class should not have constructor body.

    - avoid_storing_user_data_in_auth: true  # [WARNING] Large object in setCustomClaims. Claims are for roles, not data storage.
    - avoid_stream_subscription_in_field: true  # [WARNING] If a StreamSubscription is stored as a field in a State class but not properly cancelled in dispose(), the subscription will continue to receive events even after the widget is removed from the widget tree. This can cause memory leaks, unexpected UI updates, and subtle bugs, especially in dynamic lists or navigation flows where widgets are frequently created and destroyed. Always cancel subscriptions in the correct State object’s dispose() method. See https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/memory#dispose-resources.
    - avoid_stream_tostring: true  # [WARNING] Calling toString() on a Stream returns only the type name (e.g., 'Instance of Stream'), not the actual stream data. This leads to data loss and can mislead developers or users expecting meaningful output.
    - avoid_string_concatenation_for_l10n: true  # [WARNING] String concatenation may break word order in other languages.
    - avoid_string_concatenation_l10n: true  # [WARNING] String concatenation in UI breaks word order for translations.
    - avoid_string_concatenation_loop: true  # [INFO] Each += creates new String object, causing O(n²) memory allocations in loops.

    - avoid_test_print_statements: true  # [INFO] Print statement in test file clutters output.
    - avoid_text_scale_factor: true  # [WARNING] textScaleFactor is deprecated.
    - avoid_text_scale_factor_ignore: true  # [WARNING] Setting textScaleFactor to 1.0 on a text child element overrides user accessibility settings, preventing users from increasing text size for readability. This excludes users with low vision and fails accessibility standards. Respecting user-configured text scaling in the widget tree is essential for inclusive design.
    - avoid_throw_in_catch_block: true  # [WARNING] Throwing a new error in a catch block without preserving the original stack trace makes debugging much harder. This can hide the root cause of failures and lead to incomplete error logs, making it difficult to diagnose and fix issues.
    - avoid_time_limits: true  # [INFO] Short duration may disadvantage users who need more time. Consider longer durations or manual dismissal.
    - avoid_unassigned_late_fields: true  # [WARNING] Late field may never be assigned.

    - avoid_validation_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Complex or async validation running inside build() executes on every keystroke and widget rebuild. This causes visible input lag as network calls fire per character, floods the backend API with excessive requests, degrades performance with unnecessary widget rebuilds, and frustrates users who see delayed responses while typing in form fields.
    - avoid_variable_shadowing: true  # [WARNING] Declaration shadows a declaration from an outer scope.
    - avoid_very_long_length_files: true  # [INFO] File exceeds 1000 lines. Files this large significantly slow down IDE indexing, increase build times, and make it nearly impossible to understand the full scope of changes during code review.
    - avoid_very_long_length_test_files: true  # [INFO] Test file exceeds 2000 lines.
    - avoid_websocket_memory_leak: true  # [WARNING] WebSocketChannel is not closed in dispose(). This leaves network connections open, wasting bandwidth, battery, and server resources. Unclosed sockets can also cause app crashes or server-side issues.
    - avoid_webview_file_access: true  # [WARNING] WebView file access enabled (allowFileAccess: true) creates a critical security vulnerability. Malicious web content loaded in the WebView can read local files including user data, cached credentials, and app configuration, then exfiltrate them to attacker-controlled servers without user consent or visible indication.
    - avoid_webview_insecure_content: true  # [ERROR] Allowing mixed (HTTP and HTTPS) content in a WebView exposes users to man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, and content tampering.

    - prefer_transaction_for_batch: true  # [INFO] Multiple sequential database writes. Use transaction for atomicity.
    - prefer_transform_over_container: true  # [INFO] Container with only transform should be a Transform.
    - prefer_tween_sequence: true  # [INFO] Multiple chained animations are implemented without using TweenSequence, which can lead to complex, error-prone code and unpredictable animation timing. TweenSequence simplifies sequential animations, making them easier to manage and ensuring smooth transitions. Use TweenSequence for sequential property changes to improve maintainability and user experience.
    - prefer_typed_route_params: true  # [INFO] Route parameter from pathParameters or queryParameters is passed directly without type conversion. All route parameters are strings at runtime, and passing them where an int, double, or bool is expected causes type mismatch errors or silent data corruption.
    - prefer_url_launcher_fallback: true  # [INFO] launchUrl called without a fallback. If the scheme is unsupported, the user gets no feedback and cannot complete the action. This leads to user frustration and failed actions.
    - prefer_using_list_view: true  # [INFO] Column inside SingleChildScrollView. Consider using ListView.
    - prefer_value_listenable_builder: true  # [INFO] Simple single-value state managed with setState causes the entire widget subtree to rebuild on every change.

    - prefer_video_loading_placeholder: true  # [INFO] Video player should have a loading placeholder.
    - prefer_where_or_null: true  # [INFO] Using firstWhere/lastWhere/singleWhere with an orElse callback is verbose and harder to read. The *OrNull variant from package:collection combined with ?? produces cleaner, more idiomatic Dart code.
    - prefer_wrap_over_overflow: true  # [INFO] Row with many children may overflow - consider using Wrap.
    - proper_getx_super_calls: true  # [ERROR] Omitting a call to super in GetxController lifecycle methods (onInit, onReady, onClose) breaks the controller lifecycle, causing incomplete initialization, missed cleanup, and unpredictable behavior. This can lead to memory leaks, resource retention, and subtle bugs that are hard to diagnose.
    - require_accessible_images: true  # [WARNING] Image element lacks accessibility handling, making it invisible to screen readers and users with visual impairments. Without a semanticLabel describing the image content, assistive technologies skip over it entirely, leaving users unable to understand the visual context.

    - always_remove_getx_listener: true  # [WARNING] GetX worker is not assigned to a variable for cleanup. This will cause a memory leak.
    - avoid_absorb_pointer_misuse: true  # [INFO] AbsorbPointer blocks ALL touch events. Consider IgnorePointer instead.
    - avoid_adjacent_strings: true  # [INFO] Avoid using adjacent strings.
    - avoid_always_null_parameters: true  # [INFO] Parameter is explicitly passed as null.
    - avoid_android_task_affinity_default: true  # [INFO] Starting Android activity via platform channel. Verify taskAffinity is set in AndroidManifest.xml.
    - avoid_animation_in_large_list: true  # [WARNING] Animation widget inside ListView builder. All items run animations even when off-screen, causing performance issues.
    - avoid_autoplay_audio: true  # [INFO] Autoplay is blocked on iOS/web and annoys users.
    - avoid_badge_without_meaning: true  # [INFO] Displaying a badge with a count of 0 provides no useful information to users and can create visual noise or confusion. Badges are intended to highlight actionable or noteworthy items, and showing them when empty diminishes their value.
    - avoid_barrel_files: true  # [INFO] File contains only export statements (barrel file). Barrel files increase build times by pulling in unused code and obscure dependency tracking, making it harder to identify which modules depend on which implementations.
    - avoid_bloc_public_methods: true  # [INFO] Public method in Bloc. Use events via add() instead.
    - avoid_border_all: true  # [INFO] Prefer Border.fromBorderSide for const borders.
    - avoid_brightness_check_for_theme: true  # [INFO] Avoid checking brightness manually. Use colorScheme instead.
    - avoid_business_logic_in_ui: true  # [INFO] Widget class contains methods named with calculation or transformation verbs (calculate, compute, validate, process, etc.), indicating business logic embedded in the UI layer. This violates separation of concerns, making the logic impossible to reuse across screens, untestable without widget infrastructure, and tightly coupled to Flutter framework classes.
    - avoid_cached_isar_stream: true  # [ERROR] Caching or storing Isar/single-subscription streams in variables or fields will cause runtime errors: these streams can only be listened to once and must be created inline each time. If you cache them, your app will throw a StateError or fail to update as expected.
    - avoid_calling_of_in_build: true  # [INFO] Multiple .of(context) lookups walk the InheritedWidget ancestor chain on every rebuild call. Each lookup traverses the widget tree upward, adding cumulative overhead that slows frame rendering. This is especially costly when called multiple times in a single build method for the same provider type.
    - avoid_capturing_this_in_callbacks: true  # [INFO] Closure callback captures a reference to the entire enclosing object instance via implicit this. This prevents garbage collection of the object and all its fields for as long as the callback exists. Long-lived callbacks such as stream listeners, timers, or global event handlers create memory leaks that accumulate over the app session lifetime.
    - avoid_circular_di_dependencies: true  # [WARNING] Potential circular dependency detected.
    - avoid_circular_imports: true  # [WARNING] Circular import detected. This file is part of an import cycle.
    - avoid_collapsible_if: true  # [INFO] Nested if without else. Extra nesting reduces readability.
    - avoid_complex_arithmetic_expressions: true  # [INFO] Arithmetic expression has more than 4 operators.
    - avoid_complex_conditions: true  # [INFO] Condition has more than 3 logical operators.
    - avoid_complex_loop_conditions: true  # [INFO] Loop condition is too complex.
    - avoid_context_in_static_methods: true  # [INFO] BuildContext in static method. Consider instance method or extension instead.
    - avoid_cross_feature_dependencies: true  # [INFO] File inside a feature module imports from a different feature module directory, creating a direct cross-feature dependency. This breaks feature isolation, prevents independent development and testing of features, and makes it impossible to extract or remove a feature without cascading changes across the codebase. Cross-feature coupling also increases merge conflicts and deployment risks.
    - avoid_declaring_call_method: true  # [INFO] call() method makes class callable but hides intent. Code reads ambiguously.
    - avoid_default_tostring: true  # [INFO] Class relies on default toString() implementation which returns unhelpful output like "Instance of 'ClassName'". During debugging, logging, or error messages, developers see meaningless object identifiers instead of the actual state values needed to diagnose issues.
    - avoid_digit_separators: true  # [INFO] Unnecessary digit separator in small number.
    - avoid_dio_debug_print_production: true  # [WARNING] Using Dio LogInterceptor in production exposes sensitive request and response data—including authentication tokens, user information, and API payloads—to device logs. This can lead to data leaks, privacy violations, and compliance issues, especially on shared or rooted devices. Always restrict debug logging to development builds only.
    - avoid_dio_form_data_leak: true  # [INFO] FormData with file. Ensure proper cleanup of file resources.
    - avoid_direct_data_access_in_ui: true  # [WARNING] Widget class declares a field typed as Repository, DataSource, ApiClient, or similar data-layer class, creating a direct coupling between the UI and data implementation. This bypasses the domain/business logic layer, making the widget untestable in isolation, difficult to refactor when data sources change, and prone to leaking data concerns into the presentation layer.
    - avoid_duplicate_cascades: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate cascade operation detected.
    - avoid_duplicate_constant_values: true  # [INFO] Duplicate constant value found.
    - avoid_duplicate_initializers: true  # [INFO] Duplicate initializer expression.
    - avoid_duplicate_string_literals: true  # [INFO] String literal appears 3+ times in this file. Consider extracting to a constant.
    - avoid_duplicate_string_literals_pair: true  # [INFO] String literal appears 2+ times in this file. Consider extracting to a constant.
    - avoid_dynamic_json_access: true  # [WARNING] Chained dynamic JSON access without null checks throws NoSuchMethodError at runtime when any intermediate key is missing or null. This causes unhandled crashes in production when API responses deviate from the expected schema, with no compile-time safety net.
    - avoid_dynamic_type: true  # [INFO] Avoid using 'dynamic' type.
    - avoid_elevation_opacity_in_dark: true  # [INFO] High elevation (>4) without brightness check. Shadows look poor in dark mode.
    - avoid_encryption_key_in_memory: true  # [INFO] Encryption key stored as a persistent class field remains in process memory for the lifetime of the object. Memory dumps, debugging tools, or memory-scanning malware can extract the key, compromising all data encrypted with it. Keys in memory survive garbage collection and are visible in heap snapshots.
    - avoid_equatable_datetime: true  # [WARNING] DateTime in Equatable props may cause flaky equality checks.
    - avoid_excessive_bottom_nav_items: true  # [INFO] BottomNavigationBar with more than 5 items crowds the UI.
    - avoid_excessive_expressions: true  # [INFO] Expression has excessive complexity (>5 operators).
    - avoid_expanded_as_spacer: true  # [INFO] Use Spacer() instead of Expanded with empty child.
    - avoid_expando_circular_references: true  # [WARNING] Creating a circular reference by storing a reference to an Expando key inside its own value prevents Dart’s garbage collector from reclaiming memory, resulting in memory leaks. This subtle bug can cause your app’s memory usage to grow over time, degrade performance, and eventually lead to crashes or out-of-memory errors, especially in long-running or data-intensive applications. Such leaks are difficult to detect and debug, making it critical to avoid circular references when using Expando for metadata or caching.
    - avoid_expensive_computation_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Expensive computation detected inside build() method. Build runs on every frame during animations and on every state change, so heavy operations here cause jank, dropped frames, and sluggish UI responsiveness. Users will experience visible stuttering especially during transitions and scrolling.
    - avoid_explicit_pattern_field_name: true  # [INFO] Explicit pattern field name matches variable name.
    - avoid_extensions_on_records: true  # [INFO] Extension on record type. Records lack identity for extension discovery.
    - avoid_find_all: true  # [INFO] Generic finder (Text, Container, etc.) matches many widgets. Use specific finder.
    - avoid_find_by_text: true  # [INFO] Prefer find.byKey() for widget interactions instead of find.text().
    - avoid_firebase_realtime_in_build: true  # [WARNING] Creating Firebase stream/listener in build causes multiple subscriptions.
    - avoid_fitted_box_for_text: true  # [INFO] Avoid using FittedBox to scale Text widgets.
    - avoid_fixed_dimensions: true  # [INFO] Fixed pixel dimensions may not work on all screen sizes.
    - avoid_flexible_outside_flex: true  # [WARNING] The Flexible or Expanded widget is being used outside of a Row, Column, or Flex parent. This breaks layout expectations and can cause runtime errors or unexpected UI behavior, as Flexible/Expanded are only designed to work within Flex-based widgets. Using them elsewhere will not provide the intended flexible sizing and may result in layout exceptions.
    - avoid_font_weight_as_number: true  # [INFO] Use named FontWeight constants instead of numeric values.
    - avoid_form_in_alert_dialog: true  # [INFO] Form placed directly inside AlertDialog loses all field values, validation state, and user input when the dialog rebuilds due to a parent setState() or keyboard appearance. Because the dialog builder creates a new Form on each build call, there is no StatefulWidget to preserve form state across rebuilds, producing a frustrating experience where typed data disappears.
    - avoid_form_without_unfocus: true  # [INFO] Form submission handler does not call unfocus() before processing. The on-screen keyboard stays open after submission, blocking the success message, navigation, or dialog that confirms the action to the user. This creates a confusing experience where users cannot see feedback and may repeatedly tap the submit button.
    - avoid_freezed_for_logic_classes: true  # [INFO] Freezed annotation on logic class. Freezed is meant for data classes, not Blocs/Services.
    - avoid_function_type_in_records: true  # [INFO] Inline function type in record reduces readability.
    - avoid_generics_shadowing: true  # [WARNING] Generic type parameter shadows a top-level declaration.
    - avoid_gesture_detector_in_scrollview: true  # [WARNING] GestureDetector around scrollable can cause gesture conflicts.
    - avoid_get_find_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Calling Get.find() inside the build method is inefficient and can cause unnecessary object creation and performance issues. This leads to wasted memory allocations on every rebuild and makes your app less responsive.
    - avoid_getit_in_build: true  # [WARNING] GetIt service locator in build() hides dependencies.
    - avoid_getx_global_navigation: true  # [WARNING] GetX global navigation (Get.to, Get.off) bypasses widget context.
    - avoid_getx_rx_inside_build: true  # [WARNING] Creating .obs reactive variables inside build() allocates a new Rx instance on every rebuild. Each instance leaks because it is never disposed, and the widget observes a fresh variable each time, losing all previous state and accumulating orphaned subscriptions.
    - avoid_getx_static_context: true  # [WARNING] GetX static context method used. Hard to unit test.
    - avoid_global_key_misuse: true  # [INFO] Multiple GlobalKey instances in a single class indicate overuse of an expensive mechanism. Each GlobalKey prevents Flutter from efficiently diffing the widget tree, forces cross-tree reference tracking, and can cause unexpected widget reparenting that corrupts state and degrades rendering performance.
    - avoid_global_riverpod_providers: true  # [ERROR] Defining providers at the global scope creates implicit dependencies, makes testing difficult, and can cause state to leak between tests or app sessions. This leads to flaky tests, unpredictable bugs, and hard-to-maintain code.
    - avoid_go_router_string_paths: true  # [INFO] String literal used as a navigation path in go_router. Hardcoded path strings are error-prone, bypass compile-time validation, and break silently when route definitions change.
    - avoid_god_class: true  # [WARNING] Class declares more than 15 fields or 20 methods, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. God classes accumulate unrelated responsibilities, making them difficult to understand, test, and maintain. Changes to one responsibility risk breaking others, and the class becomes a merge-conflict magnet as multiple developers modify it concurrently.
    - avoid_graphql_string_queries: true  # [INFO] Raw GraphQL string queries lack type safety and compile-time validation.
    - avoid_hardcoded_app_name: true  # [INFO] App name should not be hardcoded in UI.
    - avoid_hardcoded_asset_paths: true  # [INFO] Asset path should not be hardcoded.
    - avoid_hardcoded_colors: true  # [INFO] Avoid hardcoded color values.
    - avoid_hardcoded_config_test: true  # [INFO] Hardcoded configuration detected in test file. Consider using a const or shared test helper.
    - avoid_hardcoded_delays: true  # [WARNING] Hardcoded delay in test is flaky. Use pumpAndSettle() instead.
    - avoid_hardcoded_duration: true  # [INFO] Hardcoded Duration values make it difficult to maintain consistent timing across the app and can lead to subtle bugs when timings need to be updated globally. This practice reduces maintainability and increases the risk of inconsistent user experiences. Always extract Duration values to named constants for clarity, reusability, and easier updates.
    - avoid_hardcoded_feature_flags: true  # [INFO] Hardcoded if(true)/if(false) suggests incomplete feature flag.
    - avoid_hardcoded_locale: true  # [INFO] Hardcoded locale ignores user's device settings.
    - avoid_hardcoded_locale_strings: true  # [WARNING] `[HEURISTIC]` Hardcoded string in Text widget. Use localization for user-visible text.
    - avoid_hardcoded_strings_in_ui: true  # [INFO] Hardcoded user-facing string. Cannot be translated to other languages.
    - avoid_icon_size_override: true  # [INFO] Avoid overriding icon size directly. Use IconTheme.
    - avoid_identical_exception_handling_blocks: true  # [INFO] Catch blocks have identical code.
    - avoid_if_with_many_branches: true  # [INFO] If statement has too many branches (max 4).
    - avoid_image_picker_large_files: true  # [WARNING] pickImage without imageQuality allows raw photos that can be 10+ MB in size, creating slow uploads and wasteful bandwidth consumption. Large image files cause network timeouts, drain battery, consume expensive mobile data, and may trigger out-of-memory errors when the app attempts to process them.
    - avoid_image_picker_without_source: true  # [WARNING] ImagePicker called without specifying an ImageSource shows a blank or empty picker dialog on some Android devices and older iOS versions. Users see a non-functional dialog and cannot select or capture images, resulting in a broken feature that provides no error feedback or alternative selection path.
    - avoid_image_repeat: true  # [INFO] ImageRepeat is rarely needed and may indicate a design issue.
    - avoid_image_without_cache: true  # [INFO] Image.network should specify cacheWidth/cacheHeight for memory efficiency.
    - avoid_immediately_invoked_functions: true  # [INFO] Function is immediately invoked after definition.
    - avoid_incomplete_copy_with: true  # [INFO] copyWith() is missing fields. Copied objects will lose data for those fields.
    - avoid_inconsistent_digit_separators: true  # [INFO] Digit separators are not grouped consistently.
    - avoid_internal_dependency_creation: true  # [INFO] Dependency created internally. Cannot substitute mock for testing.
    - avoid_inverted_boolean_checks: true  # [INFO] Inverted boolean check can be simplified.
    - avoid_ios_debug_code_in_release: true  # [INFO] Debug code detected. Ensure this is conditionally compiled out for release builds.
    - avoid_ios_deprecated_uikit: true  # [WARNING] Deprecated UIKit API pattern detected in platform channel code.
    - avoid_ios_hardcoded_bundle_id: true  # [INFO] Hardcoded bundle ID detected. Bundle IDs should come from configuration, not hardcoded strings.
    - avoid_ios_misleading_push_notifications: true  # [INFO] Marketing notification pattern detected. Push notifications must be relevant to user interests to comply with Apple guidelines.
    - avoid_isar_schema_breaking_changes: true  # [ERROR] Renaming, removing, or changing the type of a field in an Isar collection without using @Name will break migrations. This can cause data loss, failed upgrades, or app crashes for existing users.
    - avoid_json_in_main: true  # [INFO] jsonDecode on main thread blocks UI for large payloads (100KB+).
    - avoid_large_bloc: true  # [INFO] Bloc with 7+ event handlers becomes difficult to test and reason about.
    - avoid_large_isolate_communication: true  # [INFO] Sending large objects between isolates is expensive.
    - avoid_large_objects_in_state: true  # [INFO] Unbounded List, Map, Set, or ByteData field declared in a State class grows without limit as data accumulates. Without pagination or size constraints, this allocates excessive memory that degrades scroll performance, increases garbage collection pressure, and eventually crashes the app with an out-of-memory error on devices with limited RAM.
    - avoid_late_keyword: true  # [INFO] Avoid using 'late' keyword.
    - avoid_layout_builder_misuse: true  # [INFO] LayoutBuilder should use constraints in its builder.
    - avoid_layout_passes: true  # [WARNING] Using IntrinsicWidth or IntrinsicHeight causes Flutter to perform two layout passes for affected child widgets in the build tree, which significantly hurts performance, especially in complex UIs or lists. This can lead to dropped frames, laggy animations, and poor user experience. Prefer using CrossAxisAlignment.stretch, Expanded, or fixed dimensions to avoid extra layout computation.
    - avoid_loading_flash: true  # [INFO] Loading indicator shown without delay. Fast responses will cause jarring visual flash.
    - avoid_local_functions: true  # [INFO] Local function declared inside another function. Local functions increase nesting depth, cannot be tested independently, and make the enclosing function harder to read and reason about.
    - avoid_long_event_handlers: true  # [INFO] Bloc event handler is too long. Extract logic to separate methods.
    - avoid_long_functions: true  # [INFO] Function body exceeds 100 lines. Long functions are harder to understand, test in isolation, and debug because they typically handle multiple concerns and have complex control flow paths.
    - avoid_long_length_files: true  # [INFO] File exceeds 500 lines. Files this long are difficult to navigate, increase code review time, and frequently indicate that the file handles multiple unrelated concerns.
    - avoid_long_length_test_files: true  # [INFO] Test file exceeds 1000 lines.
    - avoid_long_parameter_list: true  # [INFO] Function has too many parameters (max 5). Functions with many parameters are difficult to call correctly, hard to test with all combinations, and indicate the function may be doing too much work.
    - avoid_long_records: true  # [INFO] Record has more than 5 fields.
    - avoid_macos_deprecated_security_apis: true  # [WARNING] Deprecated macOS Security API detected. Use modern equivalents.
    - avoid_medium_length_files: true  # [INFO] File exceeds 300 lines. Files beyond this threshold often contain multiple responsibilities, which makes navigation harder and increases merge conflict risk in team development.
    - avoid_medium_length_test_files: true  # [INFO] Test file exceeds 600 lines.
    - avoid_merged_semantics_hiding_info: true  # [INFO] MergeSemantics hides interactive elements from screen readers, making buttons/inputs unusable.
    - avoid_misleading_documentation: true  # [INFO] Documentation does not match the method name or code behavior. Mismatched docs confuse maintainers and lead to incorrect usage.
    - avoid_missed_calls: true  # [INFO] Function reference passed to print. Did you mean to call it?
    - avoid_missing_image_alt: true  # [INFO] This Image widget is missing a semanticLabel, which is essential for accessibility. Without a semanticLabel, screen readers cannot describe the image to visually impaired users, making your app less inclusive and potentially non-compliant with accessibility standards.
    - avoid_mixing_named_and_positional_fields: true  # [INFO] Record mixes named and positional fields.
    - avoid_multi_assignment: true  # [INFO] Multiple chained assignments detected.
    - avoid_mutable_rx_variables: true  # [WARNING] Reassigning an Rx variable with = replaces the entire reactive wrapper, breaking all existing Obx listeners that still reference the old instance. The build method stops receiving updates because child widgets observe a stale object, leading to a frozen interface that appears unresponsive.
    - avoid_navigator_push_without_route_name: true  # [INFO] Prefer named routes for better navigation management.
    - avoid_negated_conditions: true  # [INFO] Negated condition can be simplified.
    - avoid_negations_in_equality_checks: true  # [INFO] Equality check is wrapped in a negation operator !(a == b) instead of using the direct != operator. The negated form adds unnecessary cognitive overhead, increases nesting depth, and is harder to scan during code review. The != operator expresses the same intent more clearly and concisely.
    - avoid_nested_conditional_expressions: true  # [INFO] Avoid nested conditional expressions.
    - avoid_nested_extension_types: true  # [INFO] Extension type contains another extension type.
    - avoid_nested_futures: true  # [WARNING] Future<Future<T>> detected. Outer Future resolves to inner Future, not value - requires double await. Consequence: This pattern makes code harder to read, maintain, and debug, and can introduce subtle async bugs and runtime errors.
    - avoid_nested_navigators_misuse: true  # [WARNING] Nested Navigator without WillPopScope/PopScope. Back button may behave unexpectedly.
    - avoid_nested_records: true  # [INFO] Avoid nested record types.
    - avoid_nested_shorthands: true  # [INFO] Avoid nesting shorthand syntax too deeply.
    - avoid_nested_streams_and_futures: true  # [WARNING] Stream<Future<T>> or Future<Stream<T>> detected. Complex to consume - each item needs await or stream needs await. This increases cognitive load and can lead to memory leaks, unclosed stream subscriptions, or missed events.
    - avoid_nested_switch_expressions: true  # [INFO] Avoid nested switch expressions.
    - avoid_nested_switches: true  # [INFO] Avoid nested switch statements.
    - avoid_nested_try: true  # [INFO] Avoid nested try statements.
    - avoid_non_ascii_symbols: true  # [INFO] String contains non-ASCII characters.
    - avoid_non_empty_constructor_bodies: true  # [INFO] Constructor body has logic. Final fields cannot be set in body, only initializers.
    - avoid_notifier_constructors: true  # [WARNING] Notifier constructors break Riverpod lifecycle management. Initialization logic is skipped during rebuild.
    - avoid_nullable_tostring: true  # [INFO] Calling toString() on a nullable value.
    - avoid_obs_outside_controller: true  # [WARNING] .obs used outside a Getx stream controller (GetxController or GetxService) creates observables without proper lifecycle management. These observables cause memory leaks because they are never disposed when the widget tree rebuilds.
    - avoid_one_field_records: true  # [INFO] Avoid records with only one field.
    - avoid_over_fetching: true  # [INFO] Fetching full object but only using few fields. Consider optimizing.
    - avoid_overengineered_bloc_states: true  # [INFO] More than 5 state subclasses adds complexity without benefit. Harder to maintain and test.
    - avoid_passing_default_values: true  # [INFO] Empty collection argument is likely the default value.
    - avoid_passing_self_as_argument: true  # [WARNING] Object is passed as argument to its own method.
    - avoid_pop_without_result: true  # [INFO] Navigator.push awaits a result but does not handle the null case when the user dismisses the route by pressing the back button or using a system gesture. Accessing properties on a null result throws a runtime exception that crashes the app. This creates a fragile navigation flow that fails under normal user interaction patterns.
    - avoid_positional_record_field_access: true  # [INFO] Avoid accessing positional record fields with $1, $2, etc.
    - avoid_print_in_production: true  # [WARNING] Avoid using print() in production code.
    - avoid_production_config_in_tests: true  # [WARNING] Test may be using production configuration.
    - avoid_provider_in_init_state: true  # [WARNING] Accessing Provider in initState() may fail because the widget context is not fully mounted in the element tree. This can throw a ProviderNotFoundException or return stale data, causing initialization logic to operate on incorrect values or crash on first render.
    - avoid_provider_of_in_build: true  # [ERROR] Using Provider.of in build() causes the widget to rebuild every time the provider changes, which can lead to performance issues and unnecessary UI updates. This can make your app less efficient and harder to maintain.
    - avoid_qr_scanner_always_active: true  # [INFO] QR scanner should pause when app is backgrounded.
    - avoid_raw_keyboard_listener: true  # [INFO] RawKeyboardListener is deprecated. Use KeyboardListener instead.
    - avoid_recursive_calls: true  # [INFO] Function contains a recursive call to itself.
    - avoid_recursive_tostring: true  # [WARNING] toString() method calls itself recursively.
    - avoid_redundant_else: true  # [INFO] Else is redundant after return/throw/break/continue.
    - avoid_redundant_positional_field_name: true  # [INFO] Positional record field uses redundant default name.
    - avoid_redundant_pragma_inline: true  # [INFO] Pragma inline may be redundant for trivial methods.
    - avoid_repaint_boundary_misuse: true  # [INFO] RepaintBoundary around const/static content provides no benefit.
    - avoid_returning_cascades: true  # [INFO] Return statement contains a cascade expression (..operator), which obscures the actual return value and can confuse readers about whether the returned object is the cascade target or the result of the last cascade operation. Separating the cascade from the return makes the control flow explicit and easier to debug.
    - avoid_returning_void: true  # [INFO] Avoid explicitly returning void.
    - avoid_riverpod_for_network_only: true  # [INFO] Provider adds unnecessary indirection for a simple network client. Harder to debug.
    - avoid_riverpod_navigation: true  # [INFO] Riverpod provider managing navigation. Navigation belongs in widgets, not state management.
    - avoid_secure_storage_large_data: true  # [WARNING] `[HEURISTIC]` Storing large data in secure storage. It's designed for small secrets like tokens.
    - avoid_sequential_awaits: true  # [INFO] Multiple sequential awaits on independent operations. Total time is sum of all; could run in parallel.
    - avoid_service_locator_in_widgets: true  # [WARNING] Service locator in widget hides dependencies. Cannot mock in widget tests. This reduces testability, maintainability, and makes code harder to refactor.
    - avoid_service_locator_overuse: true  # [INFO] Service locator call in widget. Prefer constructor injection.
    - avoid_setstate_in_large_state_class: true  # [INFO] setState() in a large State class causes expensive full rebuilds. Consider breaking into smaller widgets or using granular state.
    - avoid_similar_names: true  # [INFO] Variable name is too similar to another.
    - avoid_single_field_destructuring: true  # [INFO] Avoid destructuring for a single field.
    - avoid_singleton_for_scoped_dependencies: true  # [INFO] Scoped data as singleton. State will persist across sessions/screens.
    - avoid_singleton_pattern: true  # [INFO] Class uses the singleton pattern (static instance field, factory constructor, and private constructor). Singletons hide dependencies, prevent mocking in unit tests, make it impossible to run tests in parallel with isolated state, and create implicit global state that is difficult to reason about and reset between test cases.
    - avoid_sized_box_expand: true  # [INFO] Avoid SizedBox.expand() as it fills all available space.
    - avoid_slow_collection_methods: true  # [INFO] Using sync* generator for simple collection may be slow.
    - avoid_snackbar_queue_buildup: true  # [INFO] Consider clearing snackbars before showing new ones.
    - avoid_sqflite_reserved_words: true  # [WARNING] Using SQLite reserved words as column names in SQL statements can cause syntax errors, failed migrations, and data loss. This is a common source of hard-to-diagnose database bugs and can break schema upgrades or queries.
    - avoid_stateful_widget_in_list: true  # [INFO] Creating StatefulWidget in list builder can cause state loss.
    - avoid_stateful_without_state: true  # [WARNING] Using a StatefulWidget without any state fields adds unnecessary complexity, increases lifecycle overhead, and can confuse maintainers. This leads to harder-to-read code, wasted memory allocations for the State object, and potential performance issues.
    - avoid_static_route_config: true  # [WARNING] Static router configuration prevents hot reload. Route changes require full restart.
    - avoid_static_state: true  # [WARNING] Static mutable state persists across hot-reloads and tests, causing stale data and inconsistent behavior. Tests fail unpredictably due to shared state leaking between runs, and production bugs become hard to reproduce across different app sessions and isolates.
    - avoid_stream_sync_events: true  # [WARNING] Stream event added synchronously right after controller creation. Listeners may not be attached yet.
    - avoid_string_concatenation_in_ui: true  # [INFO] String concatenation breaks internationalization.
    - avoid_synchronous_file_io: true  # [WARNING] Synchronous file I/O blocks the main thread, causing UI freezes and dropped frames during disk access.
    - avoid_test_implementation_details: true  # [INFO] Test verifies internal calls. Test behavior, not implementation.
    - avoid_text_in_images: true  # [INFO] Image path suggests embedded text that cannot be localized.
    - avoid_text_span_in_build: true  # [INFO] TextSpan recreated inside the build() method forces the Flutter rendering pipeline to recalculate expensive text layout metrics on every widget rebuild. This includes glyph positioning, line breaking, and paragraph layout. The repeated computation causes visible jank during scrolling and animations, especially for RichText with multiple styled spans.
    - avoid_throw_objects_without_tostring: true  # [INFO] Thrown objects without a useful toString() method produce cryptic error logs that hinder troubleshooting. When caught in production, these errors display unhelpful messages like "Instance of MyClass" instead of actionable details, making it nearly impossible to diagnose root causes from crash reports.
    - avoid_tight_coupling_with_getx: true  # [INFO] Class with 5+ GetX usages becomes tightly coupled and difficult to unit test.
    - avoid_too_many_dependencies: true  # [WARNING] Constructor has >5 dependencies. Class likely violates Single Responsibility.
    - avoid_top_level_members_in_tests: true  # [INFO] Avoid public top-level members in test files.
    - avoid_touch_only_gestures: true  # [INFO] GestureDetector with only onTap. Missing desktop/web interactions.
    - avoid_ui_in_domain_layer: true  # [WARNING] Domain-layer file (models, entities, or domain directory) references Flutter UI types such as Widget, BuildContext, Color, or TextStyle. This couples domain logic to the Flutter framework, preventing code reuse in non-Flutter contexts (CLI tools, server-side Dart, packages), breaking testability without widget infrastructure, and violating clean architecture boundaries.
    - avoid_unassigned_fields: true  # [INFO] Field may never be assigned a value.
    - avoid_unconstrained_images: true  # [INFO] Image without sizing constraints causes layout shifts on load.
    - avoid_unmarked_public_class: true  # [INFO] Public class lacks an explicit class modifier.
    - avoid_unnecessary_block: true  # [INFO] Unnecessary nested code blocks add clutter and reduce readability. They rarely serve a purpose and are often left from copy-paste or refactoring.
    - avoid_unnecessary_call: true  # [INFO] Using .call() on a function or callable is redundant. Dart automatically calls .call() when you use ().
    - avoid_unnecessary_collections: true  # [INFO] Wrapping an existing collection literal with List.of() or Set.of() creates a redundant copy, wasting memory and adding unnecessary overhead. The literal itself already produces the correct collection type.
    - avoid_unnecessary_compare_to: true  # [INFO] Using compareTo() == 0 for equality checking is unnecessarily verbose when the == operator expresses the same comparison directly. The compareTo method is designed for ordering (less than, greater than), and using it for equality adds cognitive overhead, increases code length, and obscures the developer's intent of a simple equality check.
    - avoid_unnecessary_constructor: true  # [INFO] Empty constructors are redundant—Dart provides a default constructor automatically. Leaving them in adds noise and may confuse readers.
    - avoid_unnecessary_continue: true  # [INFO] Redundant continue statement at end of loop body.
    - avoid_unnecessary_digit_separators: true  # [INFO] Unnecessary or poorly placed digit separator.
    - avoid_unnecessary_enum_arguments: true  # [INFO] Providing an argument to an enum constructor that matches the default value is unnecessary and can make the code harder to read. It may also mislead readers into thinking the value is intentionally different from the default.
    - avoid_unnecessary_enum_prefix: true  # [INFO] Using the enum type name as a prefix when referencing enum values inside the enum declaration is redundant. Dart allows you to reference enum values directly within the enum, and including the prefix adds unnecessary verbosity.
    - avoid_unnecessary_extends: true  # [INFO] All Dart classes implicitly extend Object, so explicitly writing extends Object is unnecessary and adds clutter to your class declaration. This can confuse readers and is never required.
    - avoid_unnecessary_futures: true  # [INFO] Async function has no await expressions.
    - avoid_unnecessary_gesture_detector: true  # [WARNING] GestureDetector has no gesture callbacks defined.
    - avoid_unnecessary_getter: true  # [INFO] Getter just returns a final field without additional logic.
    - avoid_unnecessary_if: true  # [INFO] Unnecessary if statement.
    - avoid_unnecessary_late_fields: true  # [INFO] Late keyword is unnecessary when field is assigned in constructor.
    - avoid_unnecessary_length_check: true  # [INFO] Use isNotEmpty instead of length comparison.
    - avoid_unnecessary_local_late: true  # [INFO] Late variable initialized immediately.
    - avoid_unnecessary_local_variable: true  # [INFO] Variable is declared, used once, and returned on the next line. This intermediate variable adds a line of code without improving readability and forces readers to track an extra name through the function.
    - avoid_unnecessary_negations: true  # [INFO] Unnecessary negation can be simplified.
    - avoid_unnecessary_nullable_fields: true  # [INFO] Nullable field appears to always have a non-null value.
    - avoid_unnecessary_nullable_parameters: true  # [INFO] Nullable parameter is never passed null.
    - avoid_unnecessary_nullable_return_type: true  # [INFO] Return type is nullable but function never returns null.

    - avoid_vague_test_descriptions: true  # [INFO] Test description is too vague.
    - avoid_watch_in_callbacks: true  # [ERROR] Using watch in callbacks (like onPressed or onTap) creates new subscriptions on every call, leading to memory leaks, redundant widget rebuilds, and degraded app performance. This can cause your app to slow down or even crash over time.
    - avoid_websocket_without_heartbeat: true  # [INFO] WebSocket without heartbeat/ping. Dead connections won't be detected.
    - avoid_webview_javascript_enabled: true  # [WARNING] WebView with JavaScript enabled expands the attack surface to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Malicious scripts injected through untrusted content can steal session tokens, access device APIs, redirect users to phishing pages, and exfiltrate sensitive data without the user's knowledge.
    - avoid_widget_creation_in_loop: true  # [INFO] Widgets created in .map() or a loop are all instantiated eagerly on every rebuild, including those currently off-screen. This causes jank, high memory usage, and slow rendering for long lists because Flutter allocates and lays out every item upfront instead of lazily constructing only visible items.
    - avoid_wrapping_in_padding: true  # [INFO] Widget has its own padding property, avoid wrapping in Padding.
    - binary_expression_operand_order: true  # [INFO] Constant placed on the left side of equality comparison (Yoda conditions). This reverses the natural reading order, making code harder to understand and increasing cognitive load when scanning through multiple comparisons.
    - check_for_equals_in_render_object_setters: true  # [WARNING] RenderObject setter should check equality before updating.
    - consistent_update_render_object: true  # [WARNING] updateRenderObject may be missing property updates from createRenderObject.
    - dispose_getx_fields: true  # [WARNING] Undisposed Worker keeps timer running after GetxController closes, causing memory leaks and stale updates.

    - function_always_returns_same_value: true  # [INFO] Function always returns the same value.
    - limit_max_imports: true  # [INFO] File has more than 20 imports. A high import count signals the file depends on too many modules, which increases coupling, makes refactoring risky, and slows incremental compilation.
    - map_keys_ordering: true  # [INFO] Map keys are not in alphabetical order, making it harder to locate specific entries, verify completeness, and review diffs. Unordered keys increase cognitive load during code reviews and maintenance.
    - match_base_class_default_value: true  # [INFO] Override has non-standard default value.
    - match_getter_setter_field_names: true  # [INFO] Getter/setter name should match the backing field.
    - match_lib_folder_structure: true  # [INFO] Test file location should mirror lib folder structure.
    - match_positional_field_names_on_assignment: true  # [INFO] Positional field name should match the variable being assigned.
    - missing_use_result_annotation: true  # [INFO] Function returns a value without @useResult annotation. Callers may accidentally ignore the return value, leading to missed error handling, lost data transformations, or incorrectly assuming the function has side effects when it does not.
    - move_records_to_typedefs: true  # [INFO] Inline record with >3 fields reduces readability.
    - move_variable_outside_iteration: true  # [INFO] Loop invariant code motion.
    - no_empty_block: true  # [INFO] An empty code block (i.e., {}) does not perform any action and may indicate incomplete code, a forgotten implementation, or a placeholder left by mistake. Empty blocks can confuse maintainers and may hide bugs or unfinished features.
    - no_equal_switch_case: true  # [INFO] Switch cases have identical bodies.
    - no_equal_switch_expression_cases: true  # [INFO] Switch expression cases have identical results.

    - no_object_declaration: true  # [INFO] Avoid declaring members with type Object.
    - pass_optional_argument: true  # [INFO] Function call omits important optional parameter, relying on default value. Future readers must hunt for the function definition to understand the omitted behavior, making code harder to comprehend and maintain at the call site.
    - prefer_abstract_dependencies: true  # [INFO] Depends on concrete implementation. Tight coupling prevents substitution.
    - prefer_abstract_final_static_class: true  # [INFO] Class with only static members should be abstract final.
    - prefer_adaptive_dialog: true  # [INFO] AlertDialog without adaptive styling. May look non-native on iOS.
    - prefer_add_all: true  # [INFO] Looping with forEach or for-in to call add() one element at a time is verbose and slower than addAll(), which can pre-allocate capacity and copy elements in bulk. This pattern also obscures the intent of batch insertion.
    - prefer_addition_subtraction_assignments: true  # [INFO] Use compound assignment operator.
    - prefer_any_or_every: true  # [INFO] Use any() or every() instead of where().isEmpty.
    - prefer_assigning_await_expressions: true  # [INFO] Inline await expression. Harder to debug and inspect intermediate values. Consequence: Extracting to a variable improves readability, makes debugging easier, and helps catch errors sooner.
    - prefer_async_await: true  # [INFO] Using .then() inside an async function can hide errors in nested callbacks and makes code harder to debug, trace, and maintain. This can lead to missed exceptions and subtle bugs in complex async flows.
    - prefer_async_callback: true  # [INFO] VoidCallback discards Futures silently. Errors will be swallowed and callers cannot await completion.
    - prefer_audio_session_config: true  # [INFO] AudioPlayer used without audio session config. May conflict with other audio.
    - prefer_autovalidate_on_interaction: true  # [INFO] AutovalidateMode.always triggers form validation on every keystroke and widget rebuild. This causes visible input lag as validators run continuously, fires excessive error messages before the user finishes typing, and degrades the user experience with distracting red error text that appears immediately on empty fields.
    - prefer_background_sync: true  # [INFO] Data sync in initState() only runs when app is open. Consider background sync for better user experience.
    - prefer_base_class: true  # [INFO] Abstract class with shared implementation could be base.
    - prefer_blank_line_before_case: true  # [INFO] Add a newline before case clause for readability.

    - prefer_blank_line_before_return: true  # [INFO] Add a blank line before the return statement.
    - prefer_bloc_listener_for_side_effects: true  # [INFO] Side effects inside BlocBuilder execute on every widget rebuild, causing user-facing errors like duplicate navigation pushes, multiple snackbars stacking on screen, or repeated API calls that waste bandwidth and may corrupt server-side state.
    - prefer_bloc_test_package: true  # [INFO] Consider using blocTest() from bloc_test package for Bloc testing.
    - prefer_boolean_prefixes_for_locals: true  # [INFO] Local boolean variable should have a prefix (is/has/can/should/will/did).
    - prefer_boolean_prefixes_for_params: true  # [INFO] Boolean parameter should have a prefix (is/has/can/should/will/did).
    - prefer_both_inlining_annotations: true  # [INFO] Use both VM and dart2js inlining pragmas.
    - prefer_builder_for_conditional: true  # [INFO] Complex widget in ternary conditional. Consider if/return for readability.
    - prefer_bytes_builder: true  # [INFO] List<int> with repeated addAll operations detected. Each addAll call may trigger memory reallocation and copying, causing O(n²) performance when building large byte arrays, resulting in slow processing and excessive memory churn.
    - prefer_cached_getter: true  # [INFO] Repeated getter calls recompute expensive values each time, wasting CPU cycles when caching would suffice.
    - prefer_cached_network_image: true  # [INFO] Consider using CachedNetworkImage for better caching.
    - prefer_camera_resolution_selection: true  # [INFO] CameraController with max resolution. Consider app-specific needs.
    - prefer_carousel_view: true  # [INFO] Consider using built-in CarouselView instead of third-party carousel.

    - prefer_commenting_analyzer_ignores: true  # [INFO] Analyzer ignore comment should have a preceding explanatory comment.
    - prefer_commenting_future_delayed: true  # [INFO] Unexplained delay is a code smell that often hides race conditions or timing bugs.
    - prefer_compound_assignment_operators: true  # [INFO] Use compound assignment operator.
    - prefer_compute_for_heavy_work: true  # [INFO] Heavy computation such as encryption, compression, or parsing runs synchronously on the main UI thread. This blocks the rendering pipeline, freezing animations, dropping frames, and making the app unresponsive to touch input for the duration of the operation. On lower-end devices, this delay is especially pronounced and triggers ANR warnings on Android.
    - prefer_conditional_expressions: true  # [INFO] if-else statement used only to assign or return different values. Using statement syntax for simple value selection adds unnecessary lines and nesting, making the code more verbose and harder to scan quickly.
    - prefer_const_border_radius: true  # [INFO] Prefer const BorderRadius.all for constant border radius.
    - prefer_const_string_list: true  # [INFO] This <String>[...] list contains only string literals and could be const.
    - prefer_const_widgets: true  # [INFO] Widget constructor could use const but is recreated on every build() call. Non-const widgets force Flutter to allocate new instances, compare entire subtrees, and perform unnecessary rebuilds. This wastes CPU cycles and battery, degrading frame rendering performance especially in frequently rebuilt parent widgets.
    - prefer_consumer_widget: true  # [ERROR] Wrapping widgets with Consumer adds unnecessary nesting and boilerplate instead of using ConsumerWidget directly. The extra widget layer causes redundant rebuilds and increases the widget tree depth, leading to harder-to-debug rebuild cascades and degraded rendering performance.
    - prefer_context_selector: true  # [INFO] context.watch() accessing property. Use select() for efficiency.
    - prefer_correct_callback_field_name: true  # [INFO] Callback field missing 'on' prefix. Flutter convention uses onPressed, onChanged.
    - prefer_correct_edge_insets_constructor: true  # [INFO] Consider using a more specific EdgeInsets constructor.
    - prefer_correct_error_name: true  # [INFO] Catch parameter uses nonstandard name. Use "e" or "error" for consistency and readability.
    - prefer_correct_future_return_type: true  # [INFO] Missing Future return type causes callers to handle dynamic, losing type safety and IDE support.
    - prefer_correct_handler_name: true  # [INFO] Event handler should start with "on" or "_on".
    - prefer_correct_identifier_length: true  # [INFO] Identifier name length is not ideal.
    - prefer_correct_setter_parameter_name: true  # [INFO] Setter parameter should be named "value".
    - prefer_correct_stream_return_type: true  # [INFO] Missing Stream return type causes listeners to receive dynamic, losing type safety and IDE support.
    - prefer_correct_switch_length: true  # [INFO] Switch statement has too few cases.
    - prefer_correct_test_file_name: true  # [INFO] Test file naming convention violation.
    - prefer_cubit_for_simple: true  # [ERROR] Using Bloc for simple state management with few events adds unnecessary boilerplate, indirection, and makes code harder to maintain. This can slow down development and introduce avoidable complexity.

    - prefer_enums_by_name: true  # [INFO] Use Enum.values.byName() instead of firstWhere with name comparison.
    - prefer_expect_later: true  # [WARNING] Use expectLater() for Future assertions.
    - prefer_explicit_function_type: true  # [INFO] Use explicit function type instead of bare "Function".
    - prefer_explicit_parameter_names: true  # [INFO] Function type parameters should have names.
    - prefer_explicit_semantics: true  # [INFO] Custom build methods lack explicit Semantics, making their child elements invisible or meaningless to screen readers and assistive technologies. All non-trivial elements in the widget tree must provide a semantic label or description for accessibility.
    - prefer_extracting_callbacks: true  # [INFO] Consider extracting this callback to a method.
    - prefer_extracting_function_callbacks: true  # [INFO] Large inline callback detected spanning 10+ lines. Inline callbacks make code harder to read, test in isolation, and reuse across multiple call sites, reducing code maintainability and increasing complexity.
    - prefer_family_for_params: true  # [ERROR] Not using .family for parameterized providers creates a new provider instance on each call, breaking caching and causing duplicate providers. This leads to wasted resources, memory leaks, and unpredictable app behavior.
    - prefer_final_class: true  # [INFO] Consider marking this class as final.
    - prefer_firestore_batch_write: true  # [INFO] Individual writes increase latency and billing costs.

    - prefer_geolocator_accuracy_appropriate: true  # [INFO] LocationAccuracy.high uses GPS and drains battery significantly.
    - prefer_geolocator_last_known: true  # [INFO] getCurrentPosition polls GPS. Consider getLastKnownPosition for cached location.
    - prefer_getter_over_method: true  # [INFO] Use a getter instead of a method that returns a value.
    - prefer_getx_builder: true  # [WARNING] .obs value accessed without Obx wrapper. UI won't rebuild.
    - prefer_hive_encryption: true  # [WARNING] Unencrypted Hive box stores data in plaintext. Anyone with device access can read sensitive user data.

    - prefer_immediate_return: true  # [INFO] Variable is declared and immediately returned.
    - prefer_implicit_animations: true  # [INFO] Simple animations such as opacity, size, or color changes are implemented with explicit AnimationController and transition widgets. This adds unnecessary complexity and increases the risk of memory leaks if disposal is missed. Prefer using implicit animation widgets like AnimatedOpacity or AnimatedContainer, which are simpler, auto-dispose, and improve code maintainability and reliability.
    - prefer_interface_class: true  # [INFO] Abstract class with only abstract members could be interface.
    - prefer_intl_message_description: true  # [INFO] Intl.message missing description (desc). Translators lack context, leading to poor or incorrect translations.

    - prefer_iso8601_dates: true  # [INFO] Use ISO 8601 format for date serialization.
    - prefer_iterable_of: true  # [INFO] Using .from() performs a runtime cast on each element, which can silently succeed with wrong types and throw later. The .of() constructor enforces type safety at the call site, catching type mismatches immediately.
    - prefer_iterable_operations: true  # [INFO] Calling .toList() at the end of an iterable chain inside a for-in loop forces eager evaluation and allocates an intermediate list that is iterated once and then discarded. This wastes memory and CPU cycles.
    - prefer_keyboard_shortcuts: true  # [INFO] Desktop app should implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
    - prefer_lazy_singleton_registration: true  # [INFO] Expensive service (Database, Analytics, Cache) registered as eager singleton. The service initializes immediately at app startup, slowing down launch time and consuming resources even if the service is never used during the session.
    - prefer_list_contains: true  # [INFO] Using indexOf() with a comparison to -1 or 0 to check element presence is verbose and error-prone. The contains() method expresses intent directly, improving readability and reducing off-by-one mistakes.
    - prefer_local_auth: true  # [INFO] Payment/sensitive operation without biometric authentication.
    - prefer_logger_over_print: true  # [INFO] Using print() for logging in production code is discouraged because print statements are not filterable, lack log levels, and may expose sensitive information in release builds.

    - prefer_match_file_name: true  # [INFO] File name should match the primary class name.
    - prefer_maybe_pop: true  # [WARNING] Navigator.pop() called without verifying that a route exists on the navigation stack to pop. When the stack is empty or contains only the root route, this call throws a FlutterError at runtime, crashing the app. On Android, this also bypasses the system back button contract, preventing the app from exiting gracefully.
    - prefer_mock_navigator: true  # [INFO] Navigator usage in test should be mocked for verification.
    - prefer_mock_verify: true  # [INFO] Mock setup with when() but no verify(). Test may pass without calling mock.

    - prefer_named_boolean_parameters: true  # [INFO] Positional boolean parameter detected. Call sites like doThing(true) give no indication what the boolean controls, forcing readers to look up the function signature to understand the intent.
    - prefer_named_extensions: true  # [INFO] Anonymous extension should be named.
    - prefer_named_parameters: true  # [INFO] Function has too many positional parameters. Call sites with multiple positional arguments like create("a", 1, true, null) are error-prone because argument order is easy to confuse and provides no self-documentation.
    - prefer_native_file_dialogs: true  # [INFO] Consider using native file dialogs on desktop.
    - prefer_notification_grouping: true  # [INFO] Multiple notifications shown in loop without groupKey. Notifications will clutter the notification shade.
    - prefer_null_aware_elements: true  # [INFO] Explicit null check with if (x != null) x in collection literals is verbose. Dart 3 supports the ?element syntax, which eliminates the boilerplate and expresses nullable inclusion more concisely.
    - prefer_null_aware_spread: true  # [INFO] Use null-aware spread (...?) for nullable collections.
    - prefer_null_object_pattern: true  # [INFO] Optional dependency (Logger, Analytics, etc.) registered as nullable type. Callers must perform null checks before every use, scattering defensive code throughout the application and increasing the risk of NullPointerExceptions.
    - prefer_nullable_provider_types: true  # [INFO] Provider type is non-nullable but create may return null.
    - prefer_opacity_widget: true  # [INFO] Consider using Opacity widget for complex child widgets.

    - prefer_pushing_conditional_expressions: true  # [INFO] Conditional expression can be pushed into arguments.
    - prefer_result_pattern: true  # [INFO] Throwing exceptions for recoverable errors like validation failures forces try-catch blocks at every call site and obscures control flow. This makes error handling inconsistent, increases boilerplate, and causes callers to miss failure cases entirely when they forget to add try-catch.
    - prefer_returning_condition: true  # [INFO] Prefer returning the condition directly.
    - prefer_returning_conditionals: true  # [INFO] Return the condition directly instead of true/false.

    - prefer_rich_text_for_complex: true  # [INFO] Multiple Text widgets in row could be combined with Text.rich.
    - prefer_riverpod_auto_dispose: true  # [INFO] Provider declared without the autoDispose modifier retains its state and resources indefinitely even after all listening child widgets are destroyed from the widget tree. This causes memory leaks, stale data accumulation, and unnecessary background computation that grows over the app lifetime, degrading performance progressively.
    - prefer_riverpod_select: true  # [INFO] ref.watch() accessing single field. Use .select() for efficiency.
    - prefer_safe_area_consumer: true  # [INFO] SafeArea may be redundant when used directly inside Scaffold body.

    - prefer_search_anchor: true  # [INFO] Consider using SearchAnchor instead of showSearch/SearchDelegate.
    - prefer_select_for_partial: true  # [ERROR] Watching the entire provider when only one field is needed causes unnecessary widget tree rebuilds, wasting memory and CPU cycles and reducing app performance. This makes your UI less efficient and responsive.
    - prefer_selectable_text: true  # [INFO] Consider using SelectableText for long content.
    - prefer_semantic_widget_names: true  # [INFO] Consider using a more semantic widget.
    - prefer_set_for_lookup: true  # [INFO] Calling contains() on a List performs a linear O(n) scan through every element, while a Set uses hash-based O(1) lookup. For collections used primarily for membership testing, this causes unnecessary performance degradation.
    - prefer_shell_route_for_persistent_ui: true  # [INFO] Multiple GoRoute builders duplicate the same bottomNavigationBar, drawer, or NavigationRail instead of sharing a single wrapper. Each route rebuilds the persistent UI independently, causing duplicated code, inconsistent selection state across tabs, visual flicker during navigation, and increased memory usage from redundant widget trees.
    - prefer_shell_route_shared_layout: true  # [INFO] GoRoute with Scaffold builder may duplicate layout code.
    - prefer_shorthands_with_constructors: true  # [INFO] Constructor call can use .new shorthand.
    - prefer_shorthands_with_enums: true  # [INFO] Enum accessed using verbose qualification (EnumType.enumValue) where shorthand (.enumValue) is available. This adds unnecessary repetition, makes code harder to read, and increases the chance of errors when refactoring enum names.
    - prefer_shorthands_with_static_fields: true  # [INFO] Static field accessed through unnecessary collection search (firstWhere, where) when direct access is available. This wastes CPU cycles iterating through values and makes code less efficient and harder to understand.
    - prefer_simpler_patterns_null_check: true  # [INFO] Verbose null check pattern reduces readability.
    - prefer_single_assertion: true  # [INFO] Test has many assertions. Consider splitting into focused tests.

    - prefer_single_widget_per_file: true  # [INFO] File contains multiple public widget classes.
    - prefer_sliver_prefix: true  # [INFO] Sliver widget class should have "Sliver" prefix.
    - prefer_specifying_future_value_type: true  # [INFO] Calling Future.value() without specifying a type returns Future<dynamic>, which loses compile-time safety. This can lead to type errors, runtime bugs, and code that is harder to maintain and refactor.
    - prefer_split_widget_const: true  # [INFO] Large widget subtree could be extracted to a const widget.
    - prefer_sqflite_batch: true  # [INFO] Database insert in loop reduces throughput by 10-100x.
    - prefer_sqflite_singleton: true  # [INFO] openDatabase called directly. May create multiple connections.
    - prefer_static_class: true  # [INFO] Class contains only static members and acts as a namespace. Static-only classes cannot be instantiated meaningfully, add unnecessary boilerplate, and prevent tree-shaking of unused members in the class.
    - prefer_static_const_widgets: true  # [INFO] Non-static const field is created per instance instead of sharing single compile-time object.
    - prefer_streaming_for_large_files: true  # [INFO] Reading potentially large file into memory. Consider streaming for logs, media, or data exports.
    - prefer_streaming_response: true  # [INFO] bodyBytes loads entire file into memory, causing OutOfMemoryError for large downloads. Stream to disk instead.
    - prefer_switch_expression: true  # [INFO] Switch statement with only return/assignment detected. Using statement syntax for simple value mapping adds unnecessary boilerplate (break statements, case keywords) and makes the code more verbose and harder to scan.
    - prefer_switch_with_enums: true  # [INFO] Enum compared using if-else chain instead of switch statement. Without exhaustiveness checking, adding new enum values will not trigger compile errors in this code location, allowing silent bugs where new cases are unhandled.
    - prefer_switch_with_sealed_classes: true  # [INFO] Sealed class handled with if-else or type checks instead of switch. Missing exhaustiveness verification allows unhandled subtypes to silently pass through, causing runtime errors or incorrect behavior when new subtypes are added.
    - prefer_tap_region_for_dismiss: true  # [INFO] Consider using TapRegion for tap-outside-to-dismiss patterns.
    - prefer_test_matchers: true  # [INFO] Use a more specific test matcher.
    - prefer_test_structure: true  # [INFO] Test file should follow proper structure conventions.
    - prefer_text_rich: true  # [INFO] Prefer Text.rich over RichText widget.

    - prefer_unique_test_names: true  # [WARNING] Duplicate test name found.
    - prefer_unmodifiable_collections: true  # [INFO] Equatable class exposes mutable collection field. External code can modify the collection contents without creating a new instance, breaking Equatable's equality contract and causing inconsistent state where equal objects have different contents.
    - prefer_unwrapping_future_or: true  # [INFO] FutureOr type detected requiring manual type checking and unwrapping. This forces runtime type inspection (is Future checks) and adds branching complexity, making the code harder to understand and more error-prone.
    - prefer_url_launcher_uri_over_string: true  # [INFO] launchUrl called with Uri.parse() on a string literal instead of constructing a Uri object directly. Uri.parse() defers validation to runtime, where malformed strings throw FormatException and crash the app.
    - prefer_url_strategy_for_web: true  # [INFO] Web app should use path URL strategy for clean URLs and SEO.
    - prefer_utc_datetimes: true  # [INFO] Consider using UTC DateTime for storage/transmission.
    - prefer_uuid_v4: true  # [INFO] Prefer UUID v4 over v1 for better randomness and privacy.
    - prefer_visible_for_testing_on_members: true  # [INFO] Test helper members should use @visibleForTesting.
    - prefer_weak_references_for_cache: true  # [INFO] Strong cache references prevent garbage collection under memory pressure.
    - prefer_webview_javascript_disabled: true  # [WARNING] WebView with JavaScript enabled expands the attack surface for cross-site scripting and remote code execution. Malicious scripts can steal authentication tokens, access device APIs through JavaScript bridges, read local storage, and exfiltrate user data to attacker-controlled servers without detection.
    - prefer_when_guard_over_if: true  # [INFO] Switch case with if statement could use a when guard.
    - prefer_widget_private_members: true  # [WARNING] Widget field should be final.
    - prefer_widget_state_mixin: true  # [INFO] Consider using WidgetStateMixin for interaction states.
    - prefer_wildcard_pattern: true  # [INFO] Unused pattern variable should use wildcard (_).
    - proper_super_calls: true  # [WARNING] Super lifecycle method called in wrong order.
    - require_android_backup_rules: true  # [INFO] Sensitive data in SharedPreferences may be included in Android auto-backup.
    - require_animation_curve: true  # [INFO] Animation uses the default linear curve, which often results in unnatural or robotic motion. Without specifying a curve, transitions may feel abrupt and lack the smoothness users expect. Always wrap with CurvedAnimation or use .animate() with a curve parameter to create more natural, visually appealing animations that enhance user experience.
    - require_animation_status_listener: true  # [INFO] AnimationController.forward() called without addStatusListener to detect completion. The animation will run but your application cannot respond when it finishes, preventing cleanup, sequencing, or triggering follow-up actions.
    - require_api_error_mapping: true  # [INFO] Raw API exceptions are exposed to users, leaking implementation details and providing unhelpful error messages. This can confuse users and expose sensitive information such as server paths, stack traces, or internal status codes. Always catch specific exceptions and map them to domain errors with clear, actionable messages to protect against information disclosure and improve error recovery.
    - require_arrange_act_assert: true  # [INFO] Test should follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
    - require_audio_focus_handling: true  # [INFO] Audio playback should configure AudioSession for proper focus handling.
    - require_biometric_fallback: true  # [INFO] Biometric-only auth locks out users with damaged sensors.
    - require_bloc_observer: true  # [ERROR] Without a BlocObserver, state transitions and errors are invisible, making it extremely difficult to debug production issues, track bugs, or monitor app health. This can lead to undetected failures and poor user experience.
    - require_bloc_repository_injection: true  # [INFO] Bloc creates its own repository. This makes testing difficult and violates dependency injection.
    - require_bloc_selector: true  # [INFO] BlocBuilder accessing single field. Use BlocSelector instead.
    - require_bloc_transformer: true  # [INFO] Bloc on<Event> without transformer processes all events sequentially.
    - require_cache_eviction_policy: true  # [WARNING] Unbounded cache consumes memory until app crashes with OutOfMemoryError after extended use.
    - require_cache_key_uniqueness: true  # [INFO] Cache key type may have unstable hashCode.
    - require_cancel_token: true  # [WARNING] Async request without cancellation continues after a StatefulWidget disposes its State, wasting bandwidth and causing setState errors. Not cancelling can lead to memory leaks, wasted network connections, and crashes from calling setState on a disposed State object after the parent removes the child from the widget tree.
    - require_certificate_pinning: true  # [WARNING] HttpClient without certificate pinning accepts any valid certificate, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers on the same network can intercept, read, and modify all HTTPS traffic including authentication tokens, personal data, and financial information without detection.
    - require_completer_error_handling: true  # [WARNING] Using a Completer in a try-catch block without calling completeError in the catch block can cause the Future to hang forever if an error occurs. This leads to memory leaks, dangling stream subscriptions, and unclosed connection handles that degrade app stability over time.
    - require_complex_logic_comments: true  # [INFO] Complex method lacks explanatory comments.
    - require_connectivity_check: true  # [INFO] Network calls without connectivity check cause poor UX with long timeouts and unhelpful error messages.
    - require_content_type_check: true  # [INFO] Parsing response without Content-Type check. May fail on error responses.
    - require_crashlytics_user_id: true  # [INFO] Crashlytics setup without setUserIdentifier. Crashes will be anonymous.
    - require_custom_painter_shouldrepaint: true  # [INFO] Always returning true from shouldRepaint causes unnecessary repaints and wastes resources.
    - require_deep_equality_collections: true  # [WARNING] Collections (List, Map, Set) in Equatable props are compared by reference, not by contents. This causes false negatives in equality checks, leading to subtle bugs, missed UI updates, broken state management, and wasted rebuilds. In production, this can result in persistent UI glitches, incorrect state restoration, and hard-to-diagnose logic errors. Collections with identical contents but different references will not compare as equal, undermining the reliability of Equatable-based state classes.
    - require_deep_link_testing: true  # [INFO] `[HEURISTIC]` Route uses object parameter instead of ID. Consider using path parameters for deep link support.
    - require_di_scope_awareness: true  # [INFO] Review DI scope: singleton retains state, factory creates each time.
    - require_dialog_result_handling: true  # [INFO] showDialog result should be awaited or handled.
    - require_dio_interceptor_error_handler: true  # [INFO] InterceptorsWrapper without onError handler. Errors may be unhandled.
    - require_dio_retry_interceptor: true  # [INFO] Dio instance without retry interceptor.
    - require_dio_ssl_pinning: true  # [WARNING] Making authentication or sensitive API requests with Dio without SSL pinning exposes your app to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where attackers can intercept or modify network traffic. This is a critical security risk for login, registration, and token endpoints. Always configure SSL pinning for all sensitive endpoints to protect user credentials and data. See https://pub.dev/packages/dio#ssl-pinning.
    - require_directional_widgets: true  # [INFO] Non-directional widget. Layout will be wrong for RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew).
    - require_drag_alternatives: true  # [INFO] `[HEURISTIC]` Drag-based widget without obvious button alternative. Some users cannot perform drag gestures.
    - require_edge_case_tests: true  # [INFO] Test file may be missing edge case tests (empty, null, boundary).
    - require_enum_unknown_value: true  # [WARNING] Enum parsing without a fallback value throws an ArgumentError when the input string does not match any enum member. Backend API changes or new enum values added server-side will crash the app in production for all users until a client update is deployed.
    - require_error_boundary: true  # [INFO] Top-level MaterialApp or CupertinoApp is missing an error boundary in its build tree. Without a dedicated error handler, uncaught exceptions will crash the entire application, leaving users with a blank or frozen screen and no recovery path. All production apps must provide a visible fallback UI for unexpected errors.
    - require_error_context: true  # [INFO] Error message is missing contextual details such as entity IDs, operation names, or relevant state. Without this context, production crash reports and logs become impossible to correlate with specific user actions, and debugging requires reproducing the exact conditions that caused the failure.
    - require_error_logging: true  # [INFO] Caught error is not logged to any logging framework or crash reporting service. Silent catch blocks make production debugging impossible because errors leave no trace in logs, crash reports, or monitoring dashboards. Without logging, you cannot detect, alert on, or diagnose failures reported by users.
    - require_error_message_context: true  # [INFO] Form validation returns a generic error message without explaining what the user did wrong or how to fix it. Vague messages like "Invalid" or "Required" frustrate users, increase form abandonment rates, and fail accessibility standards that require specific, actionable error feedback to help users correct their input.
    - require_example_in_documentation: true  # [INFO] Public class documentation should include an example.
    - require_exception_documentation: true  # [INFO] Thrown exceptions should be documented.
    - require_exclude_semantics_justification: true  # [INFO] ExcludeSemantics without justification makes accessibility audits harder to pass.
    - require_exif_handling: true  # [INFO] Image.file may show photos rotated. Consider EXIF handling.
    - require_extend_equatable: true  # [INFO] Class overrides operator == but does not extend Equatable.
    - require_file_handle_close: true  # [WARNING] File handles (e.g., RandomAccessFile) must be closed to release system resources. Failing to close files can cause resource leaks, file access errors, and may prevent other apps or processes from accessing the file. This can lead to app crashes, data loss, and degraded device performance.
    - require_finally_cleanup: true  # [INFO] Cleanup code such as close(), dispose(), or cancel() is placed in a catch block instead of a finally block. This means cleanup only runs when an exception occurs, causing resource leaks of file handles, database connections, or stream subscriptions during normal execution when no error is thrown.
    - require_firebase_app_check: true  # [INFO] Firebase initialization without App Check activation.
    - require_form_field_controller: true  # [INFO] TextFormField has no controller, onSaved, or initialValue. When the parent StatefulWidget triggers a rebuild via setState(), the field value is silently discarded because there is no mechanism to persist or retrieve the user input. This causes typed data to vanish unpredictably and forces users to re-enter their input repeatedly.
    - require_form_restoration: true  # [INFO] Form with 5+ TextEditingController fields lacks RestorationMixin. When the operating system kills the app in the background to reclaim memory, all user input is permanently lost. Users who spent time filling out a lengthy form return to find every field empty and must re-enter all data from scratch.
    - require_freezed_json_converter: true  # [INFO] Freezed class with DateTime/Color field may need a JsonConverter for correct serialization. Missing converters can cause runtime errors, silent data loss, and broken API contracts. This is a common source of serialization bugs in complex models.
    - require_future_timeout: true  # [WARNING] Executing a long-running Future (such as network or I/O operations) without a timeout can cause your app to hang indefinitely if the operation never completes. This can freeze the UI and degrade user experience.
    - require_future_wait_error_handling: true  # [INFO] Future.wait without eagerError: false. Partial results lost on failure.
    - require_geolocator_battery_awareness: true  # [WARNING] High-accuracy continuous location tracking without battery consideration drains battery quickly.
    - require_geolocator_error_handling: true  # [WARNING] Location requests must be wrapped in error handling logic. Failing to handle errors can cause app crashes, lost user trust, and poor reviews—especially when location permissions are denied or hardware fails. Unhandled exceptions may also prevent your app from passing app store review.
    - require_geolocator_service_enabled: true  # [WARNING] Location requests must check if the location service (GPS) is enabled before attempting to access position data. Failing to check service status can cause runtime errors, user confusion, and app store rejection due to non-compliance with platform requirements. On devices where GPS is disabled, location requests will fail, resulting in poor UX and potentially lost functionality.
    - require_geolocator_stream_cancel: true  # [WARNING] Position stream subscriptions must be cancelled when no longer needed. Failing to cancel subscriptions leads to battery drain, memory leaks, and background location updates that persist after the UI is disposed. This can degrade device performance and violate privacy expectations.
    - require_geolocator_timeout: true  # [WARNING] Calling getCurrentPosition without a timeLimit can cause the request to hang indefinitely if the device cannot acquire a location fix (e.g., poor GPS signal, airplane mode). This can freeze your UI and frustrate users.
    - require_getit_reset_in_tests: true  # [WARNING] GetIt singletons are not automatically reset between tests. If you do not call GetIt.I.reset(), state from one test can leak into others, causing unpredictable, flaky, or misleading results. This can hide real bugs and make tests unreliable.
    - require_getx_binding_routes: true  # [INFO] GetPage without binding parameter.
    - require_getx_controller_dispose: true  # [WARNING] GetxController holds TextEditingController or StreamSubscription fields but does not override onClose() to dispose them. Undisposed controllers and subscriptions leak native resources and continue processing events after the screen is removed, causing crashes.
    - require_go_router_refresh_listenable: true  # [INFO] GoRouter has a redirect callback but no refreshListenable. When authentication state changes (login, logout, token expiry), the router does not re-evaluate redirects, leaving users stranded on protected pages after logout or blocked from authenticated pages after login.
    - require_heading_semantics: true  # [INFO] Missing header semantics prevents screen reader users from navigating by headings.
    - require_hive_box_close: true  # [WARNING] Hive database box opened but not closed in dispose. This leaves file handles open, prevents database compaction, causes memory leaks, and can lead to data corruption or app crashes over time. Unclosed boxes may also block updates and degrade device performance.
    - require_hive_database_close: true  # [WARNING] Database opened but no close() method found. This creates a resource leak risk, leading to memory exhaustion, file locks, and possible data loss. Unclosed databases can prevent compaction and degrade app reliability.
    - require_hive_migration_strategy: true  # [INFO] @HiveType with gaps in @HiveField indices. This suggests fields were removed without migration.
    - require_http_client_close: true  # [WARNING] Unclosed HttpClient leaks socket connections and memory, eventually exhausting system resources.
    - require_https_only_test: true  # [INFO] HTTP URL detected in test file. Consider using HTTPS even in test data.
    - require_image_cache_management: true  # [INFO] Loading many images without cache management causes unbounded memory growth. The default ImageCache retains decoded images indefinitely, and without explicit eviction, memory usage climbs until the OS kills the app. Users on devices with limited RAM will experience crashes and degraded multitasking.
    - require_image_compression: true  # [INFO] Camera image captured without compression. Large files waste bandwidth.
    - require_image_dimensions: true  # [INFO] Network image should specify width and height to prevent layout shifts.
    - require_image_disposal: true  # [WARNING] Failing to dispose of images or image streams can lead to memory leaks, increased memory usage, and eventual app crashes, especially in image-heavy applications. This is critical for apps that load or manipulate images dynamically. See https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/memory#images.
    - require_image_error_fallback: true  # [INFO] Image.network used without an errorBuilder callback. When the network request fails due to connectivity issues, 404 errors, or server timeouts, Flutter displays a broken image icon placeholder. Users see an ugly, unexplained error state instead of a meaningful fallback such as a retry button or alternative content that maintains the visual layout.
    - require_image_picker_error_handling: true  # [WARNING] Using pickImage, pickVideo, or pickMultiImage without null checks or error handling can result in null dereference errors or unhandled exceptions if the user cancels the picker or a platform error occurs. This can crash your app or cause unpredictable UI states.
    - require_image_picker_result_handling: true  # [WARNING] pickImage returns null when user cancels. Missing null check causes NoSuchMethodError crash.
    - require_input_sanitization: true  # [WARNING] Unsanitized user input in SQL or commands enables injection attacks, allowing data theft or system compromise.

    - require_isar_close_on_dispose: true  # [WARNING] If you do not close the Isar instance in dispose(), file handles and system resources will leak. This can cause database corruption, prevent reopening the database, and lead to crashes or data loss on app restart.
    - require_isar_inspector_debug_only: true  # [WARNING] Enabling Isar Inspector in production exposes internal database details and can create security risks or performance issues. Inspector should only be enabled in debug mode to protect user data and app integrity.
    - require_isar_links_load: true  # [ERROR] Accessing IsarLinks without calling load() first will return incorrect or empty results. This leads to subtle data bugs, such as missing related records, and can break app features that depend on linked data.
    # DEPRECATED - require_isar_non_nullable_migration: true  # [ERROR] Making a field non-nullable without a default value will break migrations: existing database records that contain null values for this field will cause runtime deserialization errors, data loss, or schema upgrade failures when the app is updated.
    - require_isar_nullable_field: true  # [ERROR] Isar TypeAdapters bypass constructors during hydration. Non-nullable fields trigger fatal TypeErrors when encountering NULL values from legacy disk records.
    - require_isolate_for_heavy: true  # [WARNING] Heavy computation such as JSON decoding, image processing, or data parsing runs on the main thread, blocking the UI event loop. This prevents frame rendering, freezes animations, and makes the app unresponsive to user input. On lower-end devices, operations exceeding 16ms per frame cause visible stutter and dropped frames that degrade the user experience.
    - require_isolate_kill: true  # [WARNING] Unkilled Isolate continues consuming CPU and memory, and may send messages to disposed handlers causing crashes.
    - require_item_extent_for_large_lists: true  # [INFO] ListView with many items but no itemExtent forces Flutter to lay out every child widget to calculate scroll extent. This causes expensive initial rendering, prevents efficient jump-to-index operations, and degrades scroll bar accuracy, resulting in slow list initialization and janky scrolling.
    - require_json_schema_validation: true  # [INFO] JSON API response used without validation. Malformed data may crash the app or cause unexpected behavior.
    - require_keyboard_type: true  # [INFO] Text field label suggests email or phone input but no keyboardType is specified. Without TextInputType.emailAddress or TextInputType.phone, users see a generic text keyboard lacking the @ key, .com shortcut, or numeric layout. This causes input errors, slows data entry, and hurts accessibility for users who rely on specialized keyboard layouts.
    - require_keys_in_animated_lists: true  # [ERROR] Without keys, AnimatedList animations target wrong items after insert/remove operations.
    - require_live_region: true  # [INFO] Dynamic content that changes (such as error messages, notifications, or status updates) should use Semantics with liveRegion enabled. Without liveRegion, screen readers will not announce updates, leaving users unaware of important changes. This is critical for accessibility in apps with real-time or changing content.

    - require_text_overflow_in_row: true  # [INFO] Text child element inside a Row build tree has no overflow handling. When text content exceeds the available width, Flutter renders yellow and black diagonal overflow stripes that break the visual layout. Users see unreadable, clipped content with an ugly error indicator instead of gracefully truncated or wrapped text.
    - require_theme_color_from_scheme: true  # [INFO] Hardcoded color breaks theming. Use Theme.of(context).colorScheme.
    - require_token_refresh: true  # [INFO] Auth service stores access token but may lack refresh logic.
    - require_typed_api_response: true  # [INFO] Untyped API access via dynamic keys loses type safety. Typos cause runtime errors, not compile errors.
    - require_typed_di_registration: true  # [INFO] Dependency injection registration lacks explicit type parameter, relying on type inference. Type inference can fail or infer incorrect types when implementations differ from interfaces, causing runtime resolution errors that could be caught at compile time.

This causes excessive battery drain, unnecessary network requests to location services, and high CPU usage from processing redundant position updates that provide no new information.
    - prefer_go_router_redirect_auth: true  # [INFO] Authentication check detected inside a GoRoute builder instead of the router-level redirect callback. Scattering auth logic across individual page builders duplicates code, creates inconsistent enforcement, and allows new routes to accidentally skip authentication.
    - prefer_http_connection_reuse: true  # [INFO] HTTP client created inside method. Connection overhead on every call.
    - prefer_image_picker_request_full_metadata: true  # [INFO] pickImage collects EXIF metadata (GPS, timestamps) by default.

    - require_add_automatic_keep_alives_off: true  # [INFO] Long lists with addAutomaticKeepAlives: true (default) can cause memory issues.
    - require_animated_builder_child: true  # [WARNING] AnimatedBuilder should use child parameter for static widgets.
    - require_animation_tests: true  # [INFO] Animated widget test should use pump with duration.
    - require_async_error_documentation: true  # [INFO] Async function with await expressions does not document thrown exceptions or handle errors internally.

    - prefer_future_void_function_over_async_callback: false  # Prefer explicit Future<void> Function() instead of AsyncCallback.
    - prefer_generic_exception: false  # Custom exception classes add boilerplate without proportional benefit. Use generic Exception to keep error handling simple.
    - prefer_given_when_then_comments: false  # Use Arrange/Act/Assert or Given/When/Then comments in tests.
    - prefer_grouped_by_purpose: false  # Group parameters by purpose rather than required/optional.
    - prefer_grouped_expectations: false  # Isolating every assertion into its own test duplicates setup logic and inflates the test suite. Group related assertions to reduce boilerplate.
    - prefer_grouped_imports: false  # Group imports by type: dart, package, then relative.
    - prefer_guard_clauses: false  # Wrapping the entire function body in an if block obscures preconditions and increases nesting. Guard clauses make preconditions explicit and help prevent bugs.
    - prefer_if_null_over_ternary: false  # Use ?? instead of null-checking ternary expression.
    - prefer_implicit_boolean_comparison: false  # Avoid explicit comparison with boolean literals.
    - prefer_inferred_type_arguments: false  # Generic type matches inference.
    - prefer_initializing_formals: false  # Use this.field syntax instead of initializer list.

    - prefer_lower_camel_case_constants: false  # Use lowerCamelCase for constant names.
    - prefer_map_entries_iteration: false  # Use map.entries instead of iterating .keys with lookup.

    - prefer_member_ordering: false  # Class members are not in conventional order.
    - prefer_methods_before_fields: false  # Declare methods before fields in class declarations.
    - prefer_mutable_collections: false  # Return mutable collections for flexibility.
    - prefer_named_imports: false  # Package import without show/hide combinators detected. Unfiltered imports pull the entire package namespace into scope, increasing the risk of name collisions and making it unclear which symbols the file actually depends on.
    - prefer_no_blank_line_before_return: false  # Remove the blank line before the return statement.
    - prefer_no_blank_line_inside_blocks: false  # Remove blank line at start/end of block.
    - prefer_no_commented_out_code: false  # Commented-out code clutters the codebase. Delete it - git preserves history.
    - prefer_no_continue_statement: false  # Avoid using the continue statement.
    - prefer_no_getter_prefix: false  # Getter with 'get' prefix is redundant. Dart convention omits it.
    - prefer_null_aware_assignment: false  # Use ??= instead of if-null-then-assign pattern.

    - prefer_one_widget_per_file: false  # Multiple widget classes defined in a single file.
    - prefer_period_after_doc: false  # Doc comment missing period at end. Incomplete sentences reduce clarity and professionalism in API docs.
    - prefer_positive_conditions_first: false  # Guard clauses with negated conditions push the happy path deeper into the function. Positive conditions make the primary logic path prominent and easier to understand.
    - prefer_private_members_first: false  # Declare private members before public members in classes.
    - prefer_private_underscore_prefix: false  # Instance field is public without documentation, exposing internal state.
    - prefer_public_members_first: false  # Declare public members before private members in classes.
    - prefer_record_over_equatable: false  # Simple Equatable class could be replaced with a Dart 3 record.

    - prefer_screaming_case_constants: false  # Constants should use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
    - prefer_self_documenting_tests: false  # Structure comments like Arrange/Act/Assert add noise to well-written tests. Self-documenting code with clear variable names and assertions is more maintainable.
    - prefer_sentence_case_comments: false  # Comment should start with a capital letter.
    - prefer_single_blank_line_max: false  # Use at most one consecutive blank line.
    - prefer_single_exit_point: false  # Multiple return statements (early exits) make it harder to ensure cleanup, logging, and consistent resource management at the end of a function. This can lead to missed cleanup, inconsistent state, and bugs that are difficult to trace. Refactor to a single exit point so all cleanup and logging happens reliably before returning.
    - prefer_single_expectation_per_test: false  # Tests should have a single logical assertion.
    - prefer_single_quotes: false  # Use single quotes instead of double quotes for strings.
    - prefer_sizedbox_over_container: false  # Use SizedBox instead of Container for simple width/height spacing.
    - prefer_snake_case_files: false  # File name should use snake_case.
    - prefer_sorted_members: false  # Class members are not in conventional order. Inconsistent member ordering forces developers to scan the entire class to find constructors, fields, or methods, which slows navigation and code review.
    - prefer_sorted_parameters: false  # Named parameters are not in alphabetical order. Unsorted parameters force developers to scan all parameters to find the one they need, and inconsistent ordering across functions creates unnecessary cognitive load during code review.
    - prefer_sorted_pattern_fields: false  # Unsorted pattern fields slow code review and refactoring.
    - prefer_sorted_record_fields: false  # Unsorted record fields slow code review and refactoring.
    - prefer_specific_exceptions: false  # Throw specific exception types instead of generic Exception.

    - prefer_super_parameters: false  # Use super.parameter syntax instead of passing to super().
    - prefer_switch_statement: false  # Switch expressions limit flexibility for side effects and debugging. Switch statements support imperative logic, breakpoints, and multi-line case bodies.
    - prefer_sync_over_async_where_possible: false  # Marking a function async when it only returns a synchronous value adds unnecessary Future wrapping overhead and obscures intent.
    - prefer_ternary_over_collection_if: false  # Use ternary spread instead of collection-if.
    - prefer_ternary_over_if_null: false  # Use ternary expression instead of ?? for explicit control.
    - prefer_test_data_builder: false  # Complex object construction in test. Consider using builder pattern.
    - prefer_test_name_descriptive: false  # Test name is not descriptive. Rigid patterns make test failures harder to diagnose and understand.
    - prefer_test_name_should_when: false  # Test names should follow "should X when Y" pattern.
    - prefer_text_rich_over_richtext: false  # Use Text.rich() instead of RichText widget.
    - prefer_then_over_await: false  # The await keyword introduces implicit suspension points that break functional composition. Use .then() for explicit Future chaining.
    - prefer_todo_format: false  # TODO comment should follow format: TODO(author): description
    - prefer_trailing_comma_always: false  # Multi-line construct should have a trailing comma.
    - prefer_var_over_explicit_type: false  # Use var instead of explicit type when type is obvious.
    - prefer_wheretype_over_where_is: false  # Use whereType<T>() instead of where((e) => e is T).
    - prefer_widget_methods_over_classes: false  # Simple widget class could be a method in the parent widget.
    - prefer_wildcard_for_unused_param: false  # Unused parameter obscures intent. Use _ wildcard (Dart 3.7+).

    - avoid_duplicate_test_assertions: false  # [WARNING] Duplicate test assertion detected.
    - avoid_nullable_widget_methods: false  # [INFO] Avoid methods that return nullable Widget? types.
    - avoid_object_creation_in_hot_loops: false  # [WARNING] Creating objects inside hot loops triggers frequent garbage collection pauses that freeze the UI thread. Each allocation adds GC pressure proportionally to iteration count, causing visible jank, dropped frames during animations, and degraded scrolling performance on lower-end devices.
    - avoid_returning_widgets: false  # [INFO] Defining methods that return widgets (other than the build method) can make your widget tree harder to read, test, and maintain. This practice hides widget structure in private methods, reducing code clarity and making it more difficult to leverage Flutter’s hot reload and widget inspector tools.

    - prefer_providing_intl_examples: false  # [INFO] Intl.message with args but no examples.
    - prefer_small_length_files: false  # [INFO] File has more than 200 lines. Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain.
