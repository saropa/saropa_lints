    "body": "Currently the ecosystem team triages all PRs in the packages repository, but the platform teams also triage all PRs with their platform label. Due to the way PRs in packages work, however, it's relatively common for a PR to not be relevant to all the teams' triages at all times. Common examples:\r\n- One platform team may LGTM a multi-platform PR for their platform's portion, while another platform goes through review for several more weeks.\r\n- A cross-platform PR may not have high-level design approval from the ecosystem owner, at which point platform implementation review is premature.\r\n\r\nTo avoid PRs showing up repeatedly in a platform team's triage when it's not relevant, this adjusts the triage structure:\r\n- Queries for PRs in platform teams query `triage-<platform name>` rather than `platform-<platform name>`\r\n- Ecosystem triage will add the `triage-<platform name>` label during triage when a PR is ready for that platform team's consideration.\r\n- Platform teams can remove the label when it's not relevant to them (e..g, after it's been LGTM'd for that platform).\r\n\r\nThis also adds a desktop PR query, since there wasn't one, covering the separate platforms.

    "body": "## How we determine the channel name\r\n\r\nHistorically, we used the current branch's upstream to figure out the current channel name. I have no idea why. I traced it back to https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/446/files where @abarth implement this and I reviewed that PR and left no comment on it at the time.\r\n\r\nI think this is confusing. You can be on a branch and it tells you that your channel is different. That seems weird.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic to uses the current branch as the channel name.\r\n\r\n## How we display channels\r\n\r\nThe main reason this PR exists is to add channel descriptions to the `flutter channel` list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nianh@burmese:~/dev/flutter/packages/flutter_tools$ flutter channel\r\nFlutter channels:\r\n  master (tip of tree, for contributors)\r\n  main (tip of tree, follows master channel)\r\n  beta (updated monthly, recommended for experienced users)\r\n  stable (updated quarterly, for new users and for production app releases)\r\n* foo_bar\r\n\r\nCurrently not on an official channel.\r\nianh@burmese:~/dev/flutter/packages/flutter_tools$\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n\r\nI made a few other changes while I was at it:\r\n\r\n* If you're not on an official channel, we used to imply `--show-all`, but now we don't, we just show the official channels plus yours. This avoids flooding the screen in the case the user is on a weird channel and just wants to know what channel they're on.\r\n* I made the tool more consistent about how it handles unofficial branches. Now it's always `[user branch]`.\r\n* I slightly adjusted how unknown versions are rendered so it's clearer the version is unknown rather than just having the word \"Unknown\" floating in the output without context.\r\n* Simplified some of the code.\r\n* Made some of the tests more strict (checking all output rather than just some aspects of it).\r\n* Changed the MockFlutterVersion to implement the FlutterVersion API more strictly.\r\n* I made sure we escape the output to `.metadata` to avoid potential injection bugs (previously we j",

    "body": "In https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/103771, we rolled\r\ndependencies in Flutter, which triggered an update of package:coverage\r\nto v1.3.1. The new version includes\r\nhttps://github.com/dart-lang/coverage/pull/370 in which two deprecations\r\nlanded:\r\n\r\n* The `Resolver` default constructor was deprecated and replaced with\r\n  the `Resolver.create` static factory method, which unfortunately\r\n  happens to be async.\r\n* The `packagesPath` parameter to `HitMap.parseJson`, which takes the\r\n  path to the `.packages` file of the package for which coverage is to\r\n  be collected, was deprecated. This parameter was replaced with\r\n  `packagePath` in https://github.com/dart-lang/coverage/pull/370 which\r\n  was part of the overall deprecation of the .packages file in Dart\r\n  itself https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/48272. The overall goal\r\n  being that end-user code shouldn't need to know about implementation\r\n  details such as whether dependency information is stored in a\r\n  .packages file or a package_info.json file, but rather use the\r\n  package_config package to obtain the package metadata and perform\r\n  other functions such as resolving its dependencies to filesystem\r\n  paths. packagesPath was replaced by packagePath, which takes the path\r\n  to the package directory itself. Internally, package:coverage then\r\n  uses package_config to do the rest of the package/script URI\r\n  resolution to filesystem paths.\r\n\r\nThis migrates off the deprecated `packagesPath` parameter to the\r\nreplacement `packagePath` paramter.\r\n\r\nNo test since this simply migrates off a deprecated parameter and onto its\r\nreplacement; the goal is to maintain identical behaviour.\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/103830\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [X] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [X] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [",
