## DevTools / Widget Inspector Embedded in Sidebar

[#5469](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5469): Using DevTools in the sidebar no longer requires an experiment flag. By default, the Inspector page will be shown in the sidebar but this can be changed with the `dart.devToolsLocation` setting:

  > **#5469**: Remove experiment flag for DevTools in sidebar + show Inspector there by default `is enhancement` `in devtools`
  > In https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5396 we shipped an experiment to have DevTools embedded in the sidebar.
  > 
  > To try it out:
  > 
  > - Make sure you're on the latest version of the Dart extension (v3.108 or later)
  > - Add the following settings to your VS Code User Settings (or Workspace Settings to enable just for a single test project):
  >     ```js
  >     "dart.experimentalSidebarDevTools": true, // Enables the functionality
  >     "dart.devToolsLocation": {                // Sets which sections should open in the sidebar (this sets everything except cpu-profiler, for example)
  >       "default": "sidebar",                   // Ignore the warning for this, "sidebar" is a hidden value so VS Code treats it as invalid
  >       "cpu-profiler": "external"
  >     },
  > - Restart VS Code (or at least run the "Reload Window" command to restart the extension host)
  > 
  > This issue is to discuss feedback about whether this works well enough that the experimental flag should be removed and ship it.

    
    
    // Customise which sections are shown in the sidebar, in an editor tab, or external browser.
    "dart.devToolsLocation": {
    	// Default values are to show the Inspector in the sidebar and others
    	// beside the code editor.
    	"inspector": "sidebar",
    	"default": "beside",
    },

## Inline Values During Debugging

[#5426](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5426): When using the recently-released Dart 3.8 / Flutter 3.32, “inline values” will show for local variables and parameters during debugging.

  > **#5426**: Support "Inline Values" when debugging `is enhancement` `in editor` `in lsp/analysis server` `relies on sdk changes`
  > There's an issue in the SDK for the server implementation of this, but we should ensure it's called out in release notes here.
  > 
  > https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/59891
  > 
  > Basic implementation for variables/parameters looks like this:
  > 
  > https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/516cd462-7a4c-4a6d-8273-f4d6e52b2f43
  > 
  > Feedback should be collected in https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/59891

Additionally, the experimental setting `"dart.experimentalInlineValuesProperties": true` will enable inline values for getters (be aware that invoking getters may have side-effects in your program). If you try this feature out, please provide feedback on GitHub.

## Editor

  * [#2785](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2785): You can now `Ctrl+Click`/`Cmd+Click` Pub package names in `pubspec.yaml` to open the related page on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). Additionally, [@FMorschel](https://github.com/FMorschel) contributed a similar feature to `Ctrl+Click` lint names in `analysis_options.yaml` to open the related documentation on [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/).

  > **#2785**: Suggestion: Open pub.dev link from pubspec.yaml `is enhancement` `in editor` `in lsp/analysis server`
  > Hope this is the right place for a suggestion.
  > 
  > It would be nice if the popup menu of a dependency in the pubspec.yaml has a option to open `https://pub.dev/packages/` directly.




## Testing

  * [#5480](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5480): When developing in the Dart SDK repository in packages that use `package:test_reflective_loader` (such as `analyzer` or `analysis_server`), the **Go to Test** actions now navigate to the test method instead of the call to `defineReflectiveTests`. When a test fails, the error popup will also show at this new location.

  > **#5480**: Dart SDK tests command to "Go to test" doesn't work as expected `is bug`
  > **Describe the bug**
  > Running Dart SDK tests (use `defineReflectiveSuite`) and then using the context menu on a specific test to "Go to test" actually moves to `defineReflectiveSuite` line rather than the test line.
  > 
  > **To Reproduce**
  > 
  > 1. Open `pkg/analysis_server/test/src/services/correction/assist/convert_to_switch_statement_test.dart`
  > 2. Run all tests
  > 3. Use the context menu on any test to "Go to test"
  > 
  > **Expected behavior**
  > I expected it to move to the right test.
  > 
  > **Please complete the following information:**
  > 
  > Workspace Environment
  > 
  > ```text

## Misc

  * [#5515](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5515): The minimum version of VS Code for this version of the extension has been reduced from 1.96 to 1.75.

  > **#5515**: Reduce the required VS Code version `is enhancement`
  > Currently some web editors like Firebase Studio are on a lower version of VS Code than the minimum we specify in `package.json`, which means users get old versions of the extension.
  > 
  > We should try to reduce the requirement, and handle (in code) and new APIs we require for now.

  * [#5509](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5509): Recommendations for extensions (such as the Arb Editor) are no longer shown if the extension is already installed and enabled.

  > **#5509**: The Dart-Code plugin suggests to install the Google Arb editor even so it is already installed `is bug`
  > **Describe the bug**
  > When opening an arb file, e. g. the app_en.arb file for the [Flutter UI Internalization feature](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization), the Dart-Code plugin suggests to install the Google arb editor even so it is already installed by showing a message box with the message "The Google ARB Editor extension can provide validation and completion for ARB files.". When clicking the "Install Google.arb-editor" button, a box is shown permanently that displays "Installing Google.arb-editor" until the Visual Studio Code window is closed.

## Experimental Features

  * [#5516](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5516): Debug sessions can be started automatically when opening a project by adding launch configurations in a file `.dart_tool/autolaunch.json`. The format of this file is exactly the same as `.vscode/launch.json`. This feature is experimental and may change over coming releases.

  > **#5516**: [experimental] Provide a way to automatically start a debug session at launch `is enhancement` `in debugging`
  > In some contexts it can be convenient to automatically start a debug session (launched or attached) when the project is opened. For example, Firebase Studio embeds an emulator and starts a version of the Flutter app automatically, but Dart-Code is unaware of it (and therefore things like DevTools do not work).
  > 
  > It would be nice to specify a launch configuration somewhere that can be automatically started on start, which could be a full `launch`, or an `attach`. For example on Firebase Studio if we could automatically launch the config:
  > 
  > ```js
  > {
  >     "name": "Flutter app",
  >     "request": "attach",
  >     "type": "dart",
  >     "deviceId": "localhost:5555"
  > },
  > ```
  > 
  > then when you load the project you would instantly have access to DevTools for the visible app in the emulator. By attaching (instead of launching ourselves), if you have a multi-user session, both would be attached to the same instance, rather than one of them replacing the other.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

  * [#5507](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5507): [@FMorschel](https://github.com/FMorschel) contributed a fix to prevent code completion from incorrectly triggering inside dartdocs.

  > **#5507**: Code completion triggers in doc comments `is bug` `in editor` `in lsp/analysis server` `relies on sdk changes`
  > Not sure what's happened here, but when I type full-stops in doc comments, it now triggers code completion (which also contains results) where I don't think it used to.
  > 
  > ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e502fe-cf32-4912-b5cc-9820d05356b3)

  * [#5505](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5505): Labels in source code and now assigned the `label` `SemanticTokenType` allowing them to be themed or customised.

  > **#5505**: Labels are not highlighted `is bug` `in editor` `in lsp/analysis server` `relies on sdk changes`
  > **Describe the bug**
  > In dart code, labels are not highlighted.
  > 
  > **To Reproduce**
  > Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  > 1. Write a label
  > 2. Observe it is not highlighted
  > 
  > **Expected behavior**
  > TextMate or semantic token highlighting the label
  > 
  > **Screenshots**
  > 
  > ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e382d67-7d5c-47b7-9093-6f4c1b999251)
  > 
  > **Please complete the following information:**
  > 
  > You can run the **Dart: Collect Diagnostic Information** command from the VS Code command palette (`F1`) to easily capture this information or provide it manually.
  > 
  >  - Operating System and version: on macos / Version 15.4.1 (Build 24E263)
  >  - VS Code version: mac 1.99.3
  >  - Dart extension version: 3.110.0
  >  - Dart/Flutter SDK version: 3.7.2 (stable) (Tue Mar 11 04:27:50 2025 -0700) on "macos_arm64"
  >  - Target device (if the issue relates to Flutter debugging): X

  * [#5201](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5201): `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks are now foldable.

  > **#5201**: Support try/catch/finally fold `is enhancement` `in editor` `in lsp/analysis server` `relies on sdk changes`
  > A lot of times try/catch clauses can be quite large, with dozens of lines. I usually need to fold using the closest `if` to the top. But makes me wonder if wouldn't be the case to add folding capability to it.
  > 
  > At this example i can fold return but not code within brackets (try/catch)
