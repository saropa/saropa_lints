# Dart-Code v3-88

For instructions on installing the Dart or Flutter extensions, [go here](/#installation).

# v3.88.1 _2024-05-13_

  * [#5105](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5105): The `dart.experimentalMacroSupport` setting has been removed and macro support is now controlled solely by SDK experiment flags.

  > **#5105**: Remove the need for experimentalMacroSupport and gate on SDK version `is enhancement`
  > The `dart.experimentalMacroSupport` setting was used to enable new APIs to get generated code from the server into VS Code. There's been enough testing that this flag is probably unnecessary now, however we should gate enabling these new APIs on a suitable version number where this API support is more stable/complete (perhaps 3.5.0-0, since 3.5 is what current bleeding-edge builds are).

## Testing

  * [#4951](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4951): Running tests from CodeLens now obeys the `testing.openTesting` setting (note: this also requires [this fix in VS Code itself](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/209491) to ship before the fix will work).

  > When using the "Run" code lens button, I'd like vscode to open the Test Results view. It sometimes opens the Debug Console and other times the only noticeable UI change is a badge number indicator showing on the Test Explorer icon. If I use the green button to the left in the "well" (I think that's what the area is called), then it does switch to the Test Results view.

## Misc

  * [#5018](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5018): Dart and Flutter processes are no longer spawned in shells where they are not required. This should reduce the chance of processing being orphaned when some processes aren’t shut down cleanly.

  > **#5018**: Disable shellExecute in safeSpawn() when we know we don't need it `is enhancement`

  * [#4986](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4986): When `toString()` is invoked automatically in debug views, long strings are now truncated for performance reasons and consistency with other views. Evaluation in the debug console or using “Copy Value” from the context menu will still provide the full untruncated value.

  > Interestingly, the grey text in the debug variables is not truncated. So you can see the whole value if you hover over `file.value`, it shows the `File` which seems to contain the path inline inside the `File`. But I think if the variable was a primitive `String` (not a `String` within a `File`) it would be impossible to see the whole value.
