## Editor

  * [#4306](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4306): Variable names that include reserved words within them are no longer colored incorrectly when using a theme that doesn’t support semantic tokens (or are disabled).

  > **#4306**: Incorrect highlighting on some variable names that include reserved words `is bug` `in editor`

  * [#4300](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4300): Functions and methods named `get` or `set` are no longer colored incorrectly when using a theme that doesn’t support semantic tokens (or are disabled).
  * [#4216](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4216): `extends`/`implements` clauses for classes with type parameters are no longer uncolored when using a theme that doesn’t support semantic tokens (or are disabled).

  > **#4216**: Bad syntax highlighting from textmate grammar `is bug` `in editor`
  > `extends` here isn't coloured right. This might also be fixed by changes in progress in #4067.




## Flutter

  * [#4294](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4294): Enabling a new target platform for a Flutter app through the device selector no longer silently fails to set up the platform.

  > **#4294**: Enabling platforms for projects doesn't work correctly `is bug` `in flutter` `in commands`
  > Changes for #4284 may have broken this.

  * [#4313](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4313): Enabling the new SDK DAPs for Flutter pre-release branches by default has been temporarily reverted pending a fix for https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/50802. The SDK DAPs can still be opted-in to using the `dart.previewSdkDaps` setting.

  > **#4313**: Disable Flutter SDK DAP pending a fix for bug `in flutter` `in debugging`
  > See https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/50802. This is the top crash in the current Flutter beta.
  > 
  > We should bump the version number for enabling the new SDK DAP by default until this issue is fixed. We can always bring it back down, but since there can be some delay for users updating, it seems better to be on the side of caution.




## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically after you upgrade to the next (non-hotfix) Dart/Flutter SDK release. If you’re using a recent `beta` or `master` version, these items should be available to you and any issues should be reported on GitHub in the usual way.

  * [#4177](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4177): The **Extract variable** refactor now includes an explicit type when the `always_include_types` lint is enabled.

  > **#4177**: Extract variable should include type when always_include_types lint is enabled `is enhancement` `in editor` `in lsp/analysis server` `relies on sdk changes`
  > **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
  > I prefer to avoid `var` whenever possible. When I use the `extract local variable` feature, it only extracts it as var:
  > 
  > ```dart
  > text.split(" ")
  > ``` 
  > 
  > becomes
  > 
  > ```dart
  > var text2 = text.split(" ")
  > ```  
  > 
  > **Describe the solution you'd like**
  > Use the types, if provided. So:
  > ```dart
  > List text2 = text.split(" ")
  > ```

  * [#4296](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4296): When using the new SDK DAPs, debugger views (Watch, Variables) no longer include private getters that always fail if the current stack frame is from in the library that declares them. These getters were already filtered out by the original/legacy DAPs.

  > **#4296**: Debugger views include private getters which always fail if the current stack frame is from in the library that declares them `is bug` `in debugging`
  > **Describe the bug**
  > I am using VSCode to debug my flutter app. This may have been doing it for a long time. I'm new to debugging. but I noticed as im steeping through the code every variable has a property called _identityHashCode and instead of a value if I hover over it it says this.
  > ```
  > 
  > ```
  > It says this for every variable it shows in the debug window. This isnt causing any crashes or anything that I am aware of yet.
  > 
  > **To Reproduce**
  > Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  > 1. Click on Run on the top bar and choose Start Debugging
  > 2. Go to the run and debug tab on the side of vscode and expand the "This":  section to show the _identityHashCode property.
  > 3. Step through the code to show different variables. 
  > 
  > **Expected behavior**
  > A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
  > 
  > **Screenshots**
  > If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
  > I have added a screenshot of the area this is showing me

  * [#4291](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4291): When using the new SDK DAPs in a remote workspace, URLs hosting Flutter web apps and the debug proxy backend are now correctly exposed/mapped so they are accessible to the local client.

  > **#4291**: Web URLs are not exposed (app.exposeUrl) when using new SDK DAPs `is bug` `in flutter` `in debugging`
  > New DAP forward this on (via https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/114539) but needs handling here.

  * [#4292](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4292): When using the new SDK DAPs in a remote workspace, Flutter web apps will now be automatically opened on the client (as was the case with original/legacy DAPs).

  > **#4292**: Web apps are not launched for web-service device when using new SDK DAP `is bug` `in flutter` `in debugging`
  > The `app.webLaunchUrl` event isn't being passed from `flutter run` back to the client.

  * [#4293](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4293): When using the web-server device with the new SDK DAPs, it will be clearer when Flutter is waiting for you to click on the Dart Debug extension button in the launched browser window.

  > **#4293**: "Please click the Dart Debug extension button in the spawned browser window" message doesn't appear when using SDK DAP `is bug` `in flutter` `in debugging`
  > In the old debug adapter, we updated the progress with:
  > 
  > > Please click the Dart Debug extension button in the spawned browser window
  > 
  > This doesn't happen when using the SDK DAP because it was handled inside the debug adapter. ~~We should change how this works and detect it from the normal output inside the extension.~~ We can't access `output` here, so it needs doing in the DAP.
