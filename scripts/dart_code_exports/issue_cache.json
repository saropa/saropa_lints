We also can't currently tell VS Code to handle the restart because we only know about profile/release flags in launchRequest (not during startup when capabilities are exchanged).\r\n\r\nSo there are a few options:\r\n\r\n1. Do nothing. This means the restart button on the debug toolbar will not work, and instead prints an error to the console in profile/release mode:\r\n    > Failed to Hot Restart: DebugAdapterException: Exception: Restart is not supported in profile mode\r\n2. Handle restartRequest in the DAP and terminate the `flutter run` process, clean up all state, and then restart it (this is probably the best solution, but also complex)\r\n3. Pass an additional flag for profile/release mode to the `flutter debug_adapter` process so it's known before `launchRequest`, and use that to set the `supportsRestartRequest` capability.\r\n\r\n1 is ofc easiest, but I think we should probably do 2.\r\n\r\n(on a related note, we should ensure Hot Restart commands are disabled/hidden from the palette etc., since we're just implementing a standard restart here, and having Hot Restart commands show up may be confusing where it's not supporting and we will do a cold restart).",

    "body": "As part of the broader effort to support dart ecosystem extensions, we've designed a mechanism for a pub package to provide extension information as part of its package. For DevTools, this is the precompiled flutter web app that DevTools will embed. For VS Code extensions, the pub package can include a `config.yaml` file that tells the Dart-Code promotion which extension should be promoted:\r\n```\r\nmy_package/\r\n   lib/\r\n      ...\r\n   extension/\r\n      vs_code/\r\n          # contains meta data that VS code needs to point to another\r\n          # extension on the VS code marketplace\r\n         config.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n[package:extension_discovery](https://pub.dev/packages/extension_discovery) has logic to detect available extensions for a given `.dart_tool/package_config.json` file. Since this package is written in Dart, it cannot be used by the Dart-Code extension directly, so it will need to be called into from the Dart-Code extension by proxy of some other Dart service. Eventually, this would be a great fit for the [Dart Tooling Daemon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJNwgg1e_4KzY_fSU3rmSj9CXqtpGC5GmQb0cXkUGfo/edit), but since this does not exist yet, we can use the DevTools server in the interim.\r\n\r\nWe can add an API to DevTools server that the Dart-Code extension can call, and the devtools_server will call `findExtensions('vs_code', <path/to/package_config.json>)` from [package:extension_discovery](https://pub.dev/packages/extension_discovery) on the Dart-Code extension's behalf.\r\n\r\n**Open Question**\r\nThe element we still need to figure out is how to handle a monorepo workspace, where there are multiple `package_config.json` files available. \r\n\r\nRelated: [Flutter DevTools Extensions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189A-T-pcHPuds8pOtbzLS8Wl6Hr0AIAIl0aRTPvLKec/edit)",

    "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen I open the Widget Inspector, and then grab the tab and drag it outside of the main window to turn it into a separate floating window, the window goes blank and the inspector no longer works until I reload the entire app.  Even then, I have to restart my debug session and turn on the Widget Inspector again before it will show up in the floating window.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens if I drag the external tab back into the main window to dock it.\r\n\r\nSeems like the Widget Inspector has trouble re-homing itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open VSCode on a Flutter app (sample app will do)\r\n2. Debug the app (I was on Linux debugging a native linux app)\r\n3. Click the widget inspector button to show it in a tab next to the editor window.\r\n4. Drag the tab outside of the main window to undock the tab.\r\n5. Notice that it's blank.\r\n6. Do Ctrl-Shift-P and execute the \"Developer: Reload Window\" action.\r\n7. Debug the app again\r\n8. Open the widget inspector again.\r\n9. Notice that it's working again.\r\n10. Drag it back into the main window to dock it.\r\n11. Notice that it's blank again.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the Widget Inspector to just stay in the tab when I undock and dock it.\r\n\r\n## Diagnostic Information\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Workspace Environment</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n```text\r\nDart Code extension: 3.88.1\r\nFlutter extension: 3.88.0 (activated)\r\n\r\nApp: Visual Studio Code\r\nApp Host: desktop\r\nVersion: linux 1.89.1\r\n\r\nWorkspace type: Flutter (LSP)\r\n\r\nDart (3.5.0-178.0.dev): /usr/local/home/username/code/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk\r\nFlutter (3.22.0-42.0.pre.13): /usr/local/home/username/code/flutter (Linux (linux-x64/linux))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Output from 'dart info'</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n`/usr/local/home/username/code/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart info`\r\n\r\nIf providing this information as part of reporting a bug, please review the information\r\nbelow to ensure it only contains things you're comfortable posting publicly.\r\n\r\n#### General info\r\n\r\n- Dart 3.5.0-178.0.dev (dev) (Tue May 21 13:03:36 2024 -0700) on \"linux_x64\"\r\n- on linux / Linux 6.6.15-2rodete2-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.6.15-2rodete2 (2024-03-19)\r\n- locale is en_US.UTF-8\r\n\r\n#### Project info\r\n\r\n- sdk constraint: '>=3.5.0-149.0.dev <4.0.0'\r\n- dependencies: fl_chart, flutter\r\n- dev_dependencies: flutter_lints, flutter_test\r\n\r\n#### Process info\r\n\r\n|  Memory |  CPU | Elapsed time | Command line                                                                               |\r\n| ------: | ---: | -----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n|   69 MB | 0.1% |        09:04 | dart devtools --machine --allow-embedding --dtd-uri ws:<path>/4tBoG36qpoFs6Q1w             |\r\n|   65 MB | 0.0% |   1-03:50:14 | dart devtools --machine --allow-embedding --dtd-uri ws:<path>/sjoxVd77w34bIpeR             |\r\n|   76 MB | 0.0% |   3-07:53:03 | dart devtools --no-launch-browser                                                          |\r\n| 4193 MB | 0.2% |   1-03:50:14 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.88.1            |\r\n|  456 MB | 1.1% |        09:04 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.88.1            |\r\n|   77 MB | 0.0% |   1-03:50:14 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                              |\r\n|   79 MB | 0.1% |        09:04 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                              |\r\n|   94 MB | 0.1% |   1-03:50:14 | flutter_tools.snapshot daemon                                                              |\r\n|   74 MB | 0.3% |        09:04 | flutter_tools.snapshot daemon                                                              |\r\n|   72 MB | 0.1% |        07:25 | flutter_tools.snapshot debug_adapter                                                       |\r\n|   87 MB | 0.4% |        07:25 | flutter_tools.snapshot run --machine --start-paused -d linux --devtools-server-address http:<path>/ --target <path>/decision_card_main.dart |\r\n|   91 MB | 0.0% |   3-07:53:11 | flutter_tools.snapshot run --machine --track-widget-creation -d flutter-tester --start-paused |\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Output from 'flutter doctor'</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n`/usr/local/home/username/code/flutter/bin/flutter doctor -v`\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[!] Flutter (Channel main, 3.22.0-43.0.pre.3, on Debian GNU/Linux rodete 6.6.15-2rodete2-amd64, locale en_US.UTF-8)\r\n    • Flutter version 3.22.0-43.0.pre.3 on channel main at /usr/local/home/username/code/flutter\r\n    !

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nthere is a specific file (lib/auth/auth_bloc.dart) where changes will not trigger analysis (ie. if I delete a semicolon, nothing happens). Code actions will suggest fixes for the problems, but the UI does not show the error itself. \r\n\r\nI have opened the file as a txt just to make sure there weren’t any hidden annotations, and there are no files in the excluded folders for both user and workspace.\r\n\r\nI have spent quite some time trying to solve this, and irritatingly copy and pasting the code into a new file even as separate blocks does not work. Running flutter analyze and dart analyze command in the terminal will notice the changes. \r\n\r\nIf I restart my computer, any errors that exist in the file are found: they are in the problems tab, and the visual ques in the editor work as expected. However, if I then introduce an error to the file or fix an existing error the changes are not reflected in the problems tab. \r\n\r\nIf I run analyze in the terminal, fixed problems no longer appear, but the error message persists in the problem tab. Restarting the language server will erase all of the problems, regardless of if they exist or not; in both the visual ques and the problems tab. The most baffling part is that for every other file the dev tools operate normally. And I have copied over the folder to a new project and the errors persist, which can be seen here, but i have scoured the files for anything that would tell the analyzer to ignore it and I cannot find any hidden files.\r\n\r\nI have yet to test on a clean install of vs code and I copied the Auth folder over within vs code; I have not completely ruled out my VS code install and config being a problem. I have debugged to the point that to do so any further systematically would require a greater understanding of the internals of dart-code than I possess. \r\n\r\nRestarting the following proved futile:\r\n\r\n - dart analyser \r\n - the language server\r\n - vs code\r\n - my computer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThis is a sneaky bug I am not sure how i broke it because it took a while for me to notice. I can copy the file into a new project and the behaviors persist, in identical fashion, which I will call reproduction. That copy is available here: https://github.com/klukshu/inconsistent_code_analysis.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen i make an error (ie, delete a semi colon), i would expect that it would show up in the problems tab and a visual cue to appear on screen but it does not. \r\n\r\nI am curious if this problem will persist on other people's machines, I have attached a bare-bones repository, with the problematic file and all it's direct dependencies, no effort was made to make the program buildable. The behavior of auth_bloc.dart in this project is the same as in the project I copied it over from.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Workspace Environment</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n```text\r\nDart Code extension: 3.100.0\r\nFlutter extension: 3.100.0 (activated)\r\n\r\nApp: Visual Studio Code\r\nApp Host: desktop\r\nVersion: linux 1.95.3\r\n\r\nWorkspace type: Flutter (LSP)\r\nWorkspace name: inconsistent_code_analysis\r\n\r\nDart (3.5.1): redacted\r\nFlutter (3.24.1): redacted (Linux (linux-x64/linux))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Output from 'dart info'</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nIf providing this information as part of reporting a bug, please review the information\r\nbelow to ensure it only contains things you're comfortable posting publicly.\r\n\r\n#### General info\r\n\r\n- Dart 3.5.1 (stable) (Tue Aug 13 21:02:17 2024 +0000) on \"linux_x64\"\r\n- on linux / Linux 6.8.0-49-generic #49-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Nov  4 02:06:24 UTC 2024\r\n- locale is en_CA.UTF-8\r\n\r\n#### Project info\r\n\r\n- sdk constraint: '^3.5.1'\r\n- dependencies: bloc, cupertino_icons, flutter\r\n- dev_dependencies: flutter_lints, flutter_test\r\n\r\n#### Process info\r\n\r\n| Memory |  CPU | Elapsed time | Command line                                                                     |\r\n| -----: | ---: | -----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n|  68 MB | 0.1% |        04:16 | dart devtools --machine --allow-embedding --dtd-uri ws:<path>/gg2YLdGUIGhJSDxj   |\r\n| 574 MB | 2.5% |        04:16 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.100.0 |\r\n|  80 MB | 0.1% |        04:16 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                    |\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Output from 'flutter doctor'</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.24.1, on Linux Mint 22 6.8.0-49-generic, locale en_CA.UTF-8)\r\n    • Flutter version 3.24.1 \r\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\r\n    • Framework revision 5874a72aa4 (3 months ago), 2024-08-20 16:46:00 -0500\r\n    • Engine revision c9b9d5780d\r\n    • Dart version 3.5.1\r\n    • DevTools version 2.37.2\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 35.0.0)\r\n    • Android SDK at \r\n    • Platform android-35, build-tools 35.0.0\r\n    • ANDROID_HOME = \r\n    • Java binary at: \r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.11+0-17.0.11b1207.24-11852314)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✗] Chrome - develop for the web (Cannot find Chrome executable at google-chrome)\r\n    !

    "body": "In some contexts it can be convenient to automatically start a debug session (launched or attached) when the project is opened. For example, Firebase Studio embeds an emulator and starts a version of the Flutter app automatically, but Dart-Code is unaware of it (and therefore things like DevTools do not work).\n\nIt would be nice to specify a launch configuration somewhere that can be automatically started on start, which could be a full `launch`, or an `attach`. For example on Firebase Studio if we could automatically launch the config:\n\n```js\n{\n    \"name\": \"Flutter app\",\n    \"request\": \"attach\",\n    \"type\": \"dart\",\n    \"deviceId\": \"localhost:5555\"\n},\n```\n\nthen when you load the project you would instantly have access to DevTools for the visible app in the emulator. By attaching (instead of launching ourselves), if you have a multi-user session, both would be attached to the same instance, rather than one of them replacing the other.\n\nOne option would be to add a flag (`autostart: true`) to `launch.json`, however since this is a file that is often committed to source control, it probably doesn't make sense as something that is auto-generated by the script that starts the preview. Probably a better option is to create our own file (that is easily gitignored).\n\n### Location\n\nThere are a few places we could store/read such a file from:\n\n- `.vscode/` folder (existing)\n- `.dart_tool/` folder (existing)\n- `.dart_code/` folder (new)\n\nIt's not clear to me that extensions should be using `.vscode/` so probably we shouldn't use that. `.dart_tool/` can be cleared by commands like `flutter clean` so probably is also not that suitable. So perhaps we should introduce `.dart_code/` as a new workspace-level folder (which can easily be gitignored, but probably shouldn't show up for users except in some contexts). We could consider moving the existing \"New Project\" trigger files into this folder too.\n\n### .dart_code/autolaunch.json\n\nSo my current suggestion is to use `.dart_code/autolaunch.json`. The name makes it clear what this is for, and since the filename is _similar_ to `launch.json` we can use the same format (since it's what we need anyway), but we can auto-launch these without an additional flag (it also avoids the confusion of what launch configurations without an `autostart`: flag would mean in this file, since right now they would be pointless).\n\nFor simplicity, we should still put the configurations inside a `\"configurations\"` key, so the format _is_ the same as `launch.json`, because it's easier to copy/paste and compare.",

You'll find that it modified at least four other files that are completely unrelated. This has bit me a bunch of times when I go to submit a change and see unrelated changes where I have to scratch my head and wonder where they came from.\r\n\r\nI suspect this is because the analyzer is looking for the symbols, and since the symbols aren't imported into the file, it's just doing something \"smart\" with the references it finds that (sort of) match. I find it interesting that even if the symbol is a qualified symbol (e.g. `[MyOtherClass.field]`), it will still rename it.\r\n\r\nI wish it wouldn't do these unknown symbol doc comment link renames, or at least that it would ask me before doing it.\r\n\r\nIntelliJ doesn't have this problem, I think because if it can't tell for sure that a symbol matches (no analyzer link for it, I think), it'll go to an intermediary mode where it asks for confirmation and you can skip some of the renames. It groups them into \"comments\", \"doc comments\" and \"code\" too, so you can just skip the unrelated comment changes. It's annoying to hit that confirmation mode, but I haven't had problems with unrelated changes like this.",

When clicking the \"Install Google.arb-editor\" button, a box is shown permanently that displays \"Installing Google.arb-editor\" until the Visual Studio Code window is closed.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Ensure you have the Google Arb editor installed,\n2. Checkout the repository https://github.com/flutter/website.git ,\n3.

Create a new app via \"Flutter: New Project\".\r\n2. Build it for Windows, in my case.\r\n3. Attempt to evaluate any expression in VSC's debug console.\r\n4. Observe the `unable to find the library` aforementioned error from above.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nPrior to the most recent upgrade to Flutter 3+ and Dart SDK 3.2.3, it was perfectly possible not only to evaluate arbitrary operations in global context, but also to reference the declarations in the `main.dart` directly. This was extremely useful for custom debugging, which would allow for inspection of surgical precision within any runtime object that required additional monitoring, as needed.\r\n\r\nIt would be most useful to get such an option back. Running the DevTools (2.28.4) directly in the browser, furthermore, still allows to do just that - at any point in time, with or without the breakpoint. DevTools aren't nearly as versatile and free of friction as the standard built-in debug console within VSC, however. Having to go back and forth in and out of the IDE adds quite a bit of additional mental overhead as well, which doesn't exactly feel as absolutely necessary.  \r\n\r\nI see that the #4636 issue was closed as completed. Can this be considered a regression? The #4899 appears to have similar working, though the context seems to be limited to Dart only, with no mentioning of Flutter.

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe Dart extension does not issue all expected `flutter pub get` commands and does not analyze the source tree the same way depending on whether, after cloning a repository, a specific folder or a subfolder has been opened as workspace root.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. `git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/flutter/packages.git`\n2. `cd packages`, `get sparse-checkout init --cone`, `get sparse-checkout set packages/camera packages/google_maps_flutter` (this restricts checkout, so that things are faster and easier to repro)\n3. `code .`\n4. At this point, no `flutter pub get` is proposed by the Dart-Code extension, and the analyzer does not run.\n5. I now open a .dart file (for instance: `packages/camera/camera_android/lib/src/android_camera.dart`). 'flutter pub get' is proposed now. Is this exact behaviour expected?\n6. Regardless, let 'flutter pub get' commands be issued and let the analyzer run for a while. It will be quick since there are not many files in the workspace.\n\n**Actual behavior**\n- pubspec.lock files in all example folders did not get generated. Somehow, the Dart-Code extension did not see (?) the pubspec.yaml files at these locations.\n- many items will be red in the file hierarchy on the left (although these projects are known to be working) after the analyzer has finished its job.\n\nFor instance, `packages/camera/camera/example/lib/main.dart` has the following error:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:video_player/video_player.dart' // Red underline: Target of URI doesn't exist: 'package:video_player/video_player.dart'\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n- Dart-Code generating `pubspec.lock` files in all `example` subfolders.\n- no analyzer error anywhere\n\n---\n\n**To Reproduce (variant, opening the cloned folder as workspace root this time, not the parent folder)**\nCreate a new empty workspace folder, and start over from here.\n\n1. `git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/flutter/packages.git`\n2. `cd packages`, `get sparse-checkout init --cone`, `get sparse-checkout set packages/camera packages/google_maps_flutter` (this restricts checkout, so that things are faster and easier to repro)\n3. NOW do `cd packages` AGAIN, to go inside that folder. This is the important bit.\n4. `code .`\n5. You still have to open a .dart file for Dart-Code to propose to do the `flutter pub get` for you. This is still weird, but do this.\n\n**Expected and actual behaviour (this time)**\nNo analysis error.\n\nThis time:\n\n- `packages/camera/camera/example/lib/main.dart` has no error, as expected.\n- `packages/camera/camera/example/pubspec.lock` has been generated successfully, so have `packages/camera/camera/example/.flutter-plugins` and `packages/camera/camera/example/.flutter-plugins-dependencies`.\n\n**Please complete the following information:**\n\n - Operating System and version: Windows 11 24H2\n - VS Code version: 1.99.3\n - Dart extension version: 3.108.2\n - Dart/Flutter SDK version: 3.29.2 and related Dart version\n - Target device (if the issue relates to Flutter debugging): not related to debugging\n\nReproduced on two different Windows computers and a Mac with similar setup running Sequoia 15.4.1.\n",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nAt least in top-level functions, code folding can sometimes be unavailable. For example, I might be able to fold a function signature, but not the implementation block (and some but not all blocks within). While this is difficult to describe, it is most easily observed through reproduction or the videos below.\r\n\r\nThe issue does not appear to happen in Android Studio, so I'm guessing this is not an SDK issue (though VSCode can fold parameter lists, while Android Studio cannot--I'm not sure if this is intended).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter (head is f477c8b184d2364fcef0a15cee6ab5c909188229 at the time of writing)\r\n2. Open run_hot.dart (packages/flutter_tools/lib/src)\r\n3. Fold all code. This can be done by opening the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and typing _Fold All_.\r\n4. You should see multiple unfolded blocks of code. As a specific example, the body `_defaultReassembleHelper` won't be folded, and `for` loops within might not be folded as well. See screenshots below.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAll code blocks should be folded after issuing a _Fold All_ command. Interestingly, copying the contents of the file into a new editor and then using _Fold All_ appears to work as expected. However, saving the file (say, to my Desktop) will unfold the code, and if I try to _Fold All_ again, it is still slightly broken.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThe issue happening in run_hot.dart\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9027551/186756324-d407768f-3190-4b80-92cb-30b4d8e1ce55.mp4\r\n\r\nThe issue _not_ happening if I copy and paste a problematic function into a new editor:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9027551/186756680-939ba825-7c52-44da-9324-b183e5add931.mp4\r\n\r\nThe issue happening if I save the new file to disk:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9027551/186756837-88813e9f-1048-409e-9d83-c8e4e06bf0c5.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please complete the following information:**\r\n - Operating System and version: macOS Monterey 12.5.1\r\n - VS Code version: 1.70.2\r\n - Dart extension version: 3.46.1\r\n - Dart/Flutter SDK version: 2.17.6\r\n - Target device (if the issue relates to Flutter debugging): N/A\r\n\r\nI have reproduced this on Windows and another MacBook. Let me know if more information on those environments is needed.\r\n\r\n(edit: typo)",

Maybe this is a race condition?).\nUnfortunately, this is not just a cosmetic issue. It also affects the pause button in the button bar of the debugger, which will now interact with the new isolates instead of pausing / resuming the main isolate like it usually would.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe isolates (except for `main` paused on a breakpoint) are all running and should be displayed as such.\n\nI've attached a VM service to print the isolate's state shortly after hitting the breakpoint, the isolates are listed as running there. So I think this may be an issue in the extension (as opposed to something in the vm service).\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nImmediately after program start, all secondary isolates are shown as \"Paused on entry\". Then afterwards they're showing up as \"\".\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca714d7-9ced-42ce-be17-799d5bf93b8c)\n\n**Please complete the following information:**\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Workspace Environment</strong></summary>\n\n```text\nDart Code extension: 3.102.0\nFlutter extension: 3.102.0 (not activated)\n\nApp: Visual Studio Code\nApp Host: desktop\nVersion: mac 1.96.3\n\nWorkspace type: Dart (LSP)\nWorkspace name: vscode_startup_issue\n\nDart (3.6.1): /opt/homebrew/Cellar/dart/3.6.1/libexec\nFlutter (3.27.2): /Users/simon/fvm/versions/stable (No device)\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Output from 'dart info'</strong></summary>\n\n`/opt/homebrew/Cellar/dart/3.6.1/libexec/bin/dart info`\n\nIf providing this information as part of reporting a bug, please review the information\nbelow to ensure it only contains things you're comfortable posting publicly.\n\n#### General info\n\n- Dart 3.6.1 (stable) (Tue Jan 7 09:50:00 2025 -0800) on \"macos_arm64\"\n- on macos / Version 15.2 (Build 24C101)\n- locale is de-DE\n\n#### Project info\n\n- sdk constraint: '^3.6.1'\n- dependencies: sqlite_async, vm_service\n- dev_dependencies: lints, test\n\n#### Process info\n\n| Memory |  CPU | Elapsed time | Command line                                                                     |\n| -----: | ---: | -----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 116 MB | 0.0% |        22:01 | dart devtools                                                                    |\n|  30 MB | 0.0% |        38:41 | dart devtools --machine --allow-embedding --dtd-uri ws:<path>/szh7dcqvfD8=       |\n| 231 MB | 0.0% |        38:42 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.102.0 |\n| 581 MB | 0.0% |        30:56 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.102.0 |\n|  33 MB | 0.0% |        38:42 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                    |\n|  64 MB | 0.0% |        30:56 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                    |\n|  72 MB | 0.0% |        38:42 | flutter_tools.snapshot daemon                                                    |\n\n</details>",

For example if I open just `pkg/analysis_server` in the SDK (assuming it was Flutter) - would widget preview scan the entire SDK (Pub Workspace) for widget previews?\n\nI wonder if we could restrict this to just the _open_ folders (which perhaps could be done together with https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/173550?)\n\n(cc @GabrielRStabile)",

In this case, it would probably be best to have auto-import first try to work as it does now, and then have it work as in the \"easy\" solution if and only if the other way does not work.",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\n\r\nWhen I've defined a generic extension method, I see _n_ duplicate suggestions for this method when I've imported the extension into _n_ files in my project. This is annoying because it increasingly clutters the suggestions list proportionally for extension methods I frequently use.\r\n\r\n**Given:**\r\n\r\n1. Define a generic extension method such as:\r\n```dart\r\nextension LetExtension<T> on T {\r\n  R let<R>(R Function(T) op) => op(this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nin the file `let_extension.dart`;\r\n\r\n2. This extension is imported into _n_ other files in my project;\r\n\r\n3. When I trigger completion suggestions in a new file (in which the extension has **not yet** been imported) on an object, I see **_n_ + 1** occurrences of the extension method (see screenshot below).\r\n\r\n4. When I trigger completion suggestions in a file in which the extension **has already** been imported, I see only one occurrence as expected.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a new Dart project and open it in VS Code.\r\n2. Create a generic extension method, i.e. the example `T?.let()` extension method above, in a file such as `let_extension.dart`. (I've tried many parameters, including `T extends Object`, and they all seem to have the same effect).\r\n3. Create a few test files with a test function in each. Import the extension method into each of these files. Use the VS Code extension's suggestion feature to import the extension method, rather than importing the extension manually.\r\n4. As each new instance of the extension is imported into a new file, notice that the list of duplicate suggestions of that method grows with the number of files it has already been imported into.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe analyzer should (I believe?) resolve the duplicate suggestions to the same library/method and reveal only one suggestion from the original library it was either defined in or explicitly exported from.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n1. When the extension has not yet been imported, there are _n_ occurrences in the suggestions list:\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"1869\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc70d393-793a-432d-8a54-aacb1df513ec\">\r\n\r\n2. After the extension has already been imported, there is only one suggestion occurrence as expected:\r\n  <img width=\"1920\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6933b9b-0e4d-4804-84ab-1c4444c14996\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please complete the following information:**\r\n\r\nYou can run the **Dart: Collect Diagnostic Information** command from the VS Code command palette (`F1`) to easily capture this information or provide it manually.\r\n\r\n**!! ⚠️ PLEASE REVIEW THIS REPORT FOR SENSITIVE INFORMATION BEFORE SHARING ⚠️ !!**\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Workspace Environment</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n```text\r\nDart Code extension: 3.97.20240902\r\nFlutter extension: 3.97.20240902 (not activated)\r\n\r\nApp: Visual Studio Code - Insiders\r\nApp Host: desktop\r\nVersion: mac 1.93.0-insider\r\n\r\nWorkspace type: Dart (LSP)\r\nWorkspace name: test_completion\r\n\r\nDart (3.5.2): /Users/tom/flutter/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk\r\nFlutter (3.24.2): /Users/tom/flutter/flutter (No device)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Output from 'dart info'</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n`/Users/tom/flutter/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart info`\r\n\r\nIf providing this information as part of reporting a bug, please review the information\r\nbelow to ensure it only contains things you're comfortable posting publicly.\r\n\r\n#### General info\r\n\r\n- Dart 3.5.2 (stable) (Wed Aug 28 10:01:20 2024 +0000) on \"macos_arm64\"\r\n- on macos / Version 14.6.1 (Build 23G93)\r\n- locale is en-US\r\n\r\n#### Project info\r\n\r\n- sdk constraint: '^3.5.2'\r\n- dependencies: \r\n- dev_dependencies: lints, test\r\n\r\n#### Process info\r\n\r\n| Memory |  CPU | Elapsed time | Command line                                                                           |\r\n| -----: | ---: | -----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n|  69 MB | 0.0% |        25:51 | dart devtools --machine --allow-embedding --dtd-uri ws:<path>/DLNv4p7usCx2UpfG         |\r\n| 603 MB | 0.0% |        26:18 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.97.20240902 |\r\n| 796 MB | 0.0% |        25:51 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.97.20240902 |\r\n|  83 MB | 0.0% |        26:18 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                          |\r\n|  81 MB | 0.0% |        25:51 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                          |\r\n| 113 MB | 3.2% |        25:51 | flutter_tools.snapshot daemon                                                          |\r\n\r\n</details>",

For example:\n\n```\nSET DART_CODE_CONFIGURATION_PATH=/tmp/xyz123/.dart_code\n```\n\nThen when we load, we'll use this environment variable in place of `.dart_code/` when looking for (and setting up a watcher for) the auto-launch file.\n\nIf the variable is set and is a _relative_ path, then we will look for it in all workspaces (as we do with `.dart_code` by default). This means if you wanted to just rename or relocate the folder inside the tree you could, but if it's an absolute path then we will look for one (not per-workspace folder).\n\n",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe problem is that sometimes when creating a new file, one might type in an uppercase character by accident. Dart-Code then immediately shows the `lower_case_with_underscores` warning. However, fixing the issue can be rather tricky, because VSCode doesn't want to change its internal cache of file names, when the only thing that changes about the file name is the casing.\r\n\r\nFor example create a new file `test.dart` with the following contents:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n// test.dart\r\n\r\npart 'test_part.dart`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen create another file `test_Part.dart` (intentionally using an uppercase `P`):\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n// test_Part.dart\r\n\r\npart of 'test.dart';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe linter will immediatly recognize the problem and highlight it:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n// test_Part.dart\r\n\r\npart of 'test.dart';\r\n^^^^\r\nThe file name 'test_Part.dart' isn't a lower_case_with_underscores identifier.\r\nTry changing the name to follow the lower_case_with_underscores style.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow change the file name in VSCode to `test_part.dart` to fix the problem.\r\nNotice how Dart-Code still highlights the problem, although it should be fixed.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n// test_part.dart\r\n\r\npart of 'test.dart';\r\n^^^^\r\nThe file name 'test_Part.dart' isn't a lower_case_with_underscores identifier.\r\nTry changing the name to follow the lower_case_with_underscores style.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem has been analyzed thoroughly in https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3236 and the issue seems to be the internal file-name cache of VSCode. Also a solution that works reliably has been found: https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3236#issuecomment-1407740775\r\n\r\n> I managed to fix the issue by inserting an underscore at a random location in the file name, like button_s.dart. After this the warning disappeared. I then closed VSC, then reopened it, and renamed the file again back to buttons.dart. And the warning did not come back.\r\n\r\nSo the fix is for example to rename `test_part.dart` -> `test_p_art.dart` and then close/restart VSCode and again rename it back `test_p_art.dart` -> `test_part.dart`. Now VSCode has updated its internal cache, because a change was made that was not just an uppercase -> lowercase change.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a hint in the error message that shows up, that helps to fix the issue. Maybe a link to some small documentation snippet or something in this direction.\r\n\r\nIt took me 30 minutes to figure out what the problem was and how to fix it, because the solution that I have linked did not show up at the top of the Google search results and when I found it, it took a while to read through the comments to find the solution.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI don't think there is a good alternative, besides VSCode changing its weird behaviour regarding file name caching. For example offering a quick fix will probably not work, since one has to restart VSCode to make the fix work.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"718\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 17 01 17\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d786bd89-8c2f-4d73-9c41-c8773d56f08f\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "When navigating to an example in the Flutter repo source code in the form of:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n/// {@tool dartpad}\r\n/// This example shows various [ClipRRect]s applied to containers.\r\n///\r\n/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/basic/clip_rrect.0.dart **\r\n/// {@end-tool}\r\n/// ...\r\n/// {@tool dartpad}\r\n/// This example shows a [ClipRRect] that adds round corners to an image.\r\n///\r\n/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/basic/clip_rrect.1.dart **\r\n/// {@end-tool}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple examples in the comment then it says that there are two possible \"definitions\" for the destination, when the analyzer [should be supplying the full path](https://dart.googlesource.com/sdk/+/refs/heads/main/pkg/analyzer_plugin/lib/utilities/navigation/navigation_dart.dart#226) to the destination under the pointer, and so VSCode should be linkifying the entire path, not just the path element.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-09-26 16-26-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8867023/192398582-46f2d5f5-4f61-4595-bdc4-f2451115787c.png)\r\n\r\nIf there is only one example in the dartdoc block, then it more correctly links to just the link under the pointer:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-09-26 16-27-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8867023/192398709-cb2109db-7cf5-4086-9fe2-7e1b41b785c6.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to me that VSCode should be rendering the links in another color (the \"link\" color that is used by symbol refs in brackets) so that users even know that they can click on them. It's not very discoverable to have to ctrl-click on the path in a comment, since it's not expected that it is a symbol.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like in that screenshot that the tooltip/hover text is showing an empty tip, which also shouldn't happen.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open `flutter/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/basic.dart` in the Flutter repo.\r\n2. Point at the path in the \"See code in\" marker in the dartdoc block for `ClipRRect`.\r\n3. If you press Ctrl/Cmd while pointing at parts of the path, it will only highlight that part of the path, and will think there are two destinations.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n1. Draw the link in the \"link\" color, even when not pointing at it.\r\n2. When pointing at it with Ctrl/Cmd down, linkify the entire path, not just the component under the pointer.\r\n3. When clicking on the path, it should just navigate without having to disambiguate, even if there are multiple examples.\r\n4. When pointing at a link, don't show an empty tooltip.\r\n\r\n**Please complete the following information:**\r\n - Operating System and version: Debian GNU/Linux rodete 5.18.16-1rodete1-amd64\r\n - VS Code version: 1.71.2\r\n - Dart extension version: v3.48.4\r\n - Flutter extension version: v3.48.0\r\n - Dart/Flutter SDK version: Dart version 2.19.0 (build 2.19.0-229.0.dev)/Flutter version 3.4.0-29.0.pre.111\r\n",

Un-prefixed top-level blocks cannot be folded either.\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to select the lines containing the block and use the \"Create Folding Region from Selection\" command.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. In a VSCode editor, create and save a Dart file with the following contents:\r\n```dart\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  if ('i am foldable' != false) {\r\n    print(\"i can be hidden by folding `main` or my containing `if` block\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\r\n    print(\"i can only be hidden by folding main—the `for` can't be folded\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    print(\"this block can't be folded\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n2.

Connect Android devices (both wired and wireless)\n2. Run `flutter devices` to see connected devices\n3. Configure launch.json with device ID as shown in the example\n4. Attempt to run the application via VS Code debugger\n\nExample `flutter devices` output:\n```\n➜  ~ flutter devices\nFound 4 connected devices:\n  PLK110 (mobile) • 3B15AN013GM00000  • android-arm64  • Android 16 (API 36)\n  PLK110 (mobile) • 10.205.1.239:5555 • android-arm64  • Android 16 (API 36)\n  macOS (desktop) • macos             • darwin-arm64   • macOS 26.2 25C56\n  darwin-arm64\n  Chrome (web)    • chrome            • web-javascript • Google Chrome\n  143.0.7499.169\n```\n\nExample launch.json configuration:\n```json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"One Plus 15\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"type\": \"dart\",\n            \"deviceId\": \"PLK110\",\n        },\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe application should run on the specified device using the device name (e.g., \"PLK110\") as the deviceId in launch.json, as it worked in previous versions.\n\n**Current behavior**\nRegardless of whether the device is connected via wireless or wired connection, the application cannot be run by specifying the device ID in launch.json. The following error occurs:\n```\nDevice \"PLK110 (mobile)\" was not found\n```\n\nCurrently, the deviceId must be specified as either \"3B15AN013GM00000\" or \"10.205.1.239:5555\" (the full device identifier), whereas in previous versions this was not required.\n\n**Please complete the following information:**\n\nYou can run the **Dart: Collect Diagnostic Information** command from the VS Code command palette (`F1`) to easily capture this information or provide it manually.\n\n - Operating System and version: macOS\n - VS Code version: 1.107.1\n - Dart extension version: 3.124.1\n - Dart/Flutter SDK version: 3.10.3/3.38.4\n - Target device: Android devices (OnePlus PLK110)\n\n**Additional context**\nThis appears to be a regression from a previous version where specifying the device name (e.g., \"PLK110\") as deviceId in launch.json worked correctly.

Configuration Setting\n- Added `dart.mcpServerLogFile` setting in `package.json` with:\n  - Type: `[\"null\", \"string\"]` (optional string setting)\n  - Default: `null`\n  - Scope: `machine-overridable`\n  - Markdown description with workspace name and home directory substitution support\n\n### 2. Config Implementation\n- Added `mcpServerLogFile` getter in `config.ts` following the same pattern as other log file settings\n- Uses `createFolderForFile(insertWorkspaceName(resolvePaths(...)))` for proper path resolution with workspace name substitution\n\n### 3. MCP Server Provider Updates\n- Updated `DartMcpServerDefinitionProvider` to conditionally add `--log-file=${config.mcpServerLogFile}` argument when the setting is configured\n- Added `dart.mcpServerLogFile` to the configuration change listener so VS Code updates the MCP server definition when the log file setting changes\n\n## Usage Example\n\nUsers can now configure MCP server logging by setting:\n```json\n{\n  \"dart.mcpServerLogFile\": \"~/logs/mcp-server-${workspaceName}.log\"\n}\n```\n\nThis will result in the MCP server being launched with:\n```\ndart mcp-server --log-file=/path/to/logs/mcp-server-my-workspace.log\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Follows existing patterns used by other log file settings in the extension\n- Only adds the `--log-file` flag when the setting is actually configured (not null/empty)\n- Supports workspace name substitution and home directory expansion like other log file settings\n- Maintains compatibility with existing MCP server functionality\n\nFixes #5556.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\nWhen I run a project on a platform that isn't currently supported by the project, the extension asks me to add the desired platforms, which makes sense.\n\nBut when it adds it, it uses the `flutter create --platform=linux` command, which not only adds the platform, it also creates things like a test/main_test.dart, which are unrelated to adding a platform, and are confusing if you already have a project with a main.dart, but no test called main_test.dart, since now you have a test that fails if you run it, and you have no idea where that came from.\n\nThe `flutter create` command has an `--empty` argument which limits the creation of new files and simplifies the files it does create to the minimum.\n\nAdding platforms should use that.\n\nThe `--empty` arg should probably write fewer things too (it currently writes a plain README.md which is unnecessary), but that's not an extension bug.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create a project that has no platform directories.\n2. Try to run the main.\n3. When asked, say you want to add the desktop platform you're running on.\n4. Notice that there is a test/test_main.dart file.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAdding a platform should only add a platform, not create extra files.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Workspace Environment</strong></summary>\n\n```text\nDart Code extension: 3.108.2\nFlutter extension: 3.108.0 (activated)\n\nApp: Visual Studio Code\nApp Host: desktop\nVersion: mac 1.99.3\n\nWorkspace type: Dart, Flutter (LSP)\nWorkspace name: flutter\n\nDart (3.9.0-55.0.dev): /Users/user/code/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk\nFlutter (3.32.0-1.0.pre.247): /Users/user/code/flutter (Chrome (web-javascript/web))\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Output from 'dart info'</strong></summary>\n\n`/Users/user/code/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart info`\n\nIf providing this information as part of reporting a bug, please review the information\nbelow to ensure it only contains things you're comfortable posting publicly.\n\n#### General info\n\n- Dart 3.9.0-55.0.dev (dev) (Thu Apr 24 21:03:09 2025 -0700) on \"macos_arm64\"\n- on macos / Version 15.4.1 (Build 24E263)\n- locale is en\n\n#### Process info\n\n|  Memory |    CPU | Elapsed time | Command line                                                                     |\n| ------: | -----: | -----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|   62 MB |   0.0% |        00:10 | dart devtools --machine --allow-embedding --dtd-uri ws:<path>/A8nNc_cJFEc=       |\n| 1006 MB | 176.8% |        00:11 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code --client-version=3.108.2 |\n|   92 MB |   0.0% |        00:11 | flutter_tools.snapshot daemon                                                    |\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Output from 'flutter doctor'</strong></summary>\n\n`/Users/user/code/flutter/bin/flutter doctor -v`\n\n```text\n[!] Flutter (Channel main, 3.32.0-1.0.pre.247, on macOS 15.4.1 24E263 darwin-arm64, locale en) [1,838ms]\n    • Flutter version 3.32.0-1.0.pre.247 on channel main at /Users/user/code/flutter\n    !

    "body": "This is a fix (workaround) for a potentially serious issue debugging Flutter on Windows with the incoming VS Code (editor) release. I plan to ship it a Dart-Code pre-release shortly (today) to get some testing and may ship in a stable release tomorrow or Thursday.\r\n\r\n@andrewkolos @jwren @helin24 I would appreciate additional eyes over this change before the stable release if possible. It's not a particularly nice workaround but it's currently all I have.\r\n\r\nA summary of the issue:\r\n\r\nA recent breaking change in NodeJS means spawning a `.bat` shell script on Windows without explicitly setting `shell: true` will fail with an `EINVAL` error. The upcoming release of the VS Code editor (being prepared and likely to ship this or next week) updates to a version of NodeJS that includes that change. Our extension code has always used `shell: true` where necessary, however the Debug Adapter (`flutter debug_adapter`) is not started directly by us in the extension - instead, we pass a `executable: string, args: string[]` to the VS Code editor and it spawns the process. It does not provide the ability for us to tell it to use `shell: true`. I have filed https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/224184 and (open a PR at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/224204 with a fix) however because it's close to release and my proposed fix was an API change, it will not be merged before the stable VS Code release.\r\n\r\nIf we do nothing, Windows users will be unable to launch Flutter debug sessions with the upcoming VS Code release (and this is already the case for those using Insider builds of VS Code).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, when using the affected version of VS Code (on Windows), I am substituting `\"sdk-path\\bin\\flutter.bat debug_adapter\"` with the equivalent command that the shell script runs `\"(sdk-path)\\bin\\cache\\dart-sdk\\bin\\dart --packages=\"...\" (tool-snapshot-path) debug_adapter`. This works for me locally in Insiders, and is passing all of the  (previously failing) CI tests run against insiders.\r\n\r\nAs I was writing this, VS Code devs agreed to look at another fix (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/224184#issuecomment-2258617405) so we might not need this - however I'm going to continue with putting this into a pre-release extension for additional testing so if they are unable to ship a fix, we have this to fall back on (and it isn't completely untested).\r\n\r\n(I'm merging it so it can go into the pre-release so this PR will be closed, but if you have any feedback or concerns, please still leave them here and I will address).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5183",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen you have two classes with the same name, there may be some places where you'd like one over the other because they have no relation.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nAdd the following code to your `main.dart` file:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'my_class_name.dart' as i;\r\n\r\nclass MyClassName {}\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  f();\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid f(i.MyClassName c) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd a new file called `my_class_name.dart` and inside it add:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nclass MyClassName {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow inside the call for `f`, add `My` and try to fill the class, it only shows the class from this library.\r\n\r\nEven if you only have class declarations with that name from other files like say you add a `second.dart` file with the same content as `my_class_name.dart`. Import it with the alias `s` and remove `MyClassName` declaration from inside `main.dart` (some changes to `f` as well, look the following code). It will not be able to show both declarations (not ever the second one without the `s.`). \r\n\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'my_class_name.dart' as i;\r\nimport 'second.dart' as s;\r\n\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  f2(My);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid f1(i.MyClassName c) {}\r\nvoid f2(s.MyClassName c) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf now you try and get the code completion it will still show only `i.MyClassName`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49a335db-6d6a-4d68-b26e-a943e2ecd7a4)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect all declarations to be visible with code completion if you try to create an instance (or if you have the defined type you could derive from that).\r\n\r\nAlso, if I have `MyClassName` inside `main.dart` and no imports, I expect it to show me there are other files I could import for the same name class (especially if I'm trying to create an instance to fill a parameter that has another class - same name - from another library).

    "body": "## Description\n\nIn a multi-root VS Code workspace with multiple Flutter/Dart projects, the Test Explorer shows all tests in a flat list without grouping them by workspace folder. This makes it difficult to identify which tests belong to which project in monorepo setups.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nTests are listed by file path without workspace folder grouping:\n```\n📄 admin/test/auth_test.dart\n  └── AuthService\n📄 mobile/test/auth_test.dart\n  └── AuthService  \n📄 admin/test/user_test.dart\n  └── UserService\n```\n\nTests from different projects are interleaved, making it confusing to identify which project a test belongs to, especially when test names are similar.\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nTests grouped under workspace folder nodes (similar to Source Control view):\n```\n🌐 Admin (Flutter Web)\n  └── 📄 auth_test.dart\n      └── AuthService\n  └── 📄 user_test.dart\n      └── UserService\n📱 Mobile (Flutter)\n  └── 📄 auth_test.dart\n      └── AuthService\n```\n\nThe folder names from `.code-workspace` should be used for the grouping nodes.\n\n## Use Case\n\nMonorepo with separate admin/mobile/web Flutter apps in a single repository, using a `.code-workspace` file to define workspace folders. This is common for teams maintaining multiple related Flutter applications.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a setting `dart.testGroupByWorkspaceFolder` (default: `true` for multi-root workspaces, `false` for single-folder) that creates top-level `TestItem` nodes for each workspace folder, parenting file-based test items under their respective folder.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Multi-root workspaces show tests grouped under workspace folder names\n2. Single-folder workspaces behave unchanged (no extra nesting)\n3. Workspace folder names from `.code-workspace` are used\n4. Setting available to disable grouping if user prefers flat view\n5. \"Run All Tests\" on a folder node runs only that folder's tests\n\n## Related\n\n- Python extension has similar request: microsoft/vscode-python#20345\n- Java Test extension implements this pattern: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-test\n\n## Environment\n\n- Dart Code: 3.124.0\n- VS Code: 1.95.x\n- Workspace type: Multi-root with 2 Flutter projects\n\n---\n\nI'm happy to contribute a PR for this if the feature would be welcome. I've reviewed the codebase and believe the implementation would primarily involve modifications to `VsCodeTestController`.",

    "body": "\r\nThis issue is in service of https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/144902. The goal is to make contributing to the `flutter` tool a better experience.\r\n\r\n**Repro steps.** I did all of this with my local Flutter installation on the `master` branch, but I don't think this should matter for this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Open your local flutter installation in VSCode. Make sure you have at least one editor active with a dart file. I used `packages/flutter_tools/test/general.shard/bundle_builder_test.dart` for this example.\r\n2. Quit VSCode.\r\n3. With a terminal open at your local Flutter installation, `git clean -dfx` to effectively clean out any cached files.\r\n4. Open your local flutter installation in VSCode (I assume that any Dart/Flutter-enabled project should be sufficient for this). VSCode should then download relevant Flutter artifacts and build the `flutter` tool.\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior.** In VSCode, make sure you have the Explorer tab open (this should include the file explorer and outline by default). Notice that the outline is not populated.

Whether it is set to \"chrome\" or \"default\", it always opens in \"default\", which is Edge on my system.  Note that this *only* is an issue for me in WSL, and the setting works appropriately in Windows natively.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Set default browser on your system to Edge (or something else non-Chrome)\n2. Open VS Code in WSL2 Ubuntu\n3. Set the \"Dart: Dev Tools Browser\" setting to \"chrome\"\n4. debug a Dart program\n5. At a breakpoint, open devtools in browser\n6.

Please describe.**\r\nI have two cases where the test folder structure does not match the src/ folder structure.\r\n\r\n1\\) One of the intermediate folders was omitted (ex. instead of `test/impl/another/**` all tests are put into `test/another/**`). Which looks easy to fix unless you have 1000 tests that need to be updated + some test rely on the relative file paths which makes it a bit problematic. Although, I agree that it's mostly the consequences of my bad decisions and should not probably be covered by the extension feature.\r\n\r\nHowever, while investigating this I figured out there is another case:\r\n2) Let's say I have a list of similar classes located in `classes/` (ex. `classes/some.dart`, `classes/another.dart`, etc.), but in order to test these classes I need some additional data that cannot be placed inside the test file, but is expected to be close to the test file in order to be easily updatable, avoid any potential cross-test dependencies and so on. So the test files are all placed inside their own directories \"classes/some/\", \"classes/another\", etc. with their test data being in a separate inner folder. This makes the folder structure asymmetrical between the implementation and test files and the only way right now to make the \"Go To Test File\" command to work is to place each implementation file in their own directory and having multiple directories with only one file complicates the project structure.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA way for the \"Go To Test File\" command to be able to open test files do not have the exact match of impl file FS path.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAnother command or any other way to achieve that.\r\n\r\n",

This works well.\n\nIf instead you place your mouse over the `data` variable in the source code you're in for a bad time because it requests without any `\"count\"` parameter and the VM then happily does what it was asked on all 268435456 elements - eventually (on my machine) running out of memory somewhere in `return elements.mapIndexed([...]).toList();` in `ProtocolConverter.convertVmInstanceToVariablesList`.\nUntil it fails (after a while) debugging is unresponsive, and the debugging session can't even be stopped (without killing the running `dart debug_adapter` processing).\nI suspect that if we had a size that was small enough that it wouldn't cause out-of-memory on the dart side the IDE would be in for a bad time once it had to receive that data. (Okay, I couldn't help myself: Reducing it to 1mio does indeed make the IDE use lots of CPU and lots of memory. There might even be a memory leak - after doing it with 1 mio 5 times (I think - that is start a debugging session, hover, click \"continue\" and wait until it actually continues, start the 2nd one etc) the memory consumption of the (remote) vs code according to the chrome task manager is now 2.1+ GB...)\n\n**Expected behavior**\nEither it only shows the first x (100?) entries, or (preferably) it would give the same drop-downs as the variables on the left.\n\n**Please complete the following information:**\n\n```text\nDart Code extension: 3.112.0\nFlutter extension: 3.112.0 (not activated)\n\nApp: code-server\nApp Host: server-distro\nRemote: 127.0.0.1:49363\nHost Kind: server-distro\nVersion: linux 1.91.1\n\nWorkspace type: Dart (LSP)\nWorkspace name: profiling\n\nDart (3.9.0-edge): (my checkout)\nFlutter (3.29.3): (my checkout)\n```",

So I think we need to capture the suffix for the original type, and just manually append that onto the result of `getDisplayString(withNullability: false)` for each result.\r\n\r\nBefore I do this, a) do you know if there are any cases where the current behaviour is expected (or the described behaviour above would be worse), or whether there's something existing that's cleaner than manipulating strings here to get `type.superclass` where the result has the nullability suffix propagated?\r\n\r\n(I'm also not entirely sure we should be adding tabstops on these types/param names.. you can tab through them, but not the bodies of the inserted methods... but that's another issue).",

These were never intended for use outside of tests, but some other extensions have started using them to get access to things they can't easily get elsewhere (for example the SDK paths or Outline data).\n\nBecause these classes were never meant as public API, they often change in breaking ways so we should remove them and only expose them when running in a test run. But first we should try to provide alternatives for extensions where it's reasonable. This issue tracks the known extensions using these APIs, what they use, and whether they have migrated off them.\n\nThe initial API provides access to the DTD URI and the current SDK paths (https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/pull/5583).

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen starting a flutter project using `flutter run` outside of vscode and then attaching the debugger inside vscode by running `>Debug: Attach to Flutter on Device` and pasting the URI provided by flutter, it is possible to set a breakpoint in a file and the debugger also stops the app, but it doesn't give any information about the current state and doesn't highlight the line that's paused on. The problem only occurs if in vscode the flutter project is nested in subfolder. As setting the breakpoint and breaking on it works correctly, but from then on it's pretty useless, it's hard to figure out what's wrong.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a flutter project in a subfolder of the current vscode workspace (`mkdir -p flutter-test/src; code flutter-test; cd flutter-test/src; flutter create .`)\r\n2. Start the flutter app using the CLI on a connected (android) device (`flutter run`)\r\n3. Attach to the running flutter app on the connected device\r\n4. Set a breakpoint, ensure the corresponding code is executed\r\n5. Locate call stack, notice it only says \"unknown source\"; check code, notice it doesn't highlight the current line when stepping; \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nEither setting the breakpoint should fail with a meaningful error message or locating the source should work not only for setting the breakpoints but also for resolving the debugged code.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1775745/151964723-f132e50f-2700-43ca-ab72-d8fc4ef708fb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Versions (please complete the following information):**\r\n - VS Code Version: 1.63.2\r\nCommit: 899d46d82c4c95423fb7e10e68eba52050e30ba3\r\nDate: 2022-01-19T16:00:00.869Z\r\nElectron: 13.6.7\r\nChromium: 91.0.4472.164\r\nNode.js: 14.16.0\r\nV8: 9.1.269.40-electron.0\r\nOS: Linux x64 5.16.2-arch1-1\r\n - Dart extension version:  v3.34.0\r\n - Dart/Flutter SDK version: Flutter (Channel stable, 2.5.3, on Arch Linux 5.16.2-arch1-1, locale en_US.UTF-8\r\n",

This is in comparison to running `dart test` for the same project from the command line - test execution there is on the order of a few seconds (`6.90s` for 7,590 tests).

For one of our projects (https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/tree/main/pkgs/dart_services, the backend of dartpad), it traverses down into several (very large) subdirectories where we wouldn't want tests discovered or run from.\r\n\r\nOne of the local directories is `flutter-sdks/`; this contains a copy of the flutter sdk.\r\n\r\nAnother is `local_pub_cache/`; this contains a sub-set of a local pub cache.\r\n\r\nBoth directories are ignored from the POV of git (via a .gitignore) and analysis (via an analysis options file - https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/blob/main/pkgs/dart_services/analysis_options.yaml#L8).\r\n\r\nI suspect the issue here is that we can't just look in `test` in order to handle cases where the user has opened several packages at once). Perhaps we could stop traversing down into dirs once we see a directory w/ a pubspec? Or, we could have the traverseral algorithm respect the glob excludes from the analysis options files.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `Testing` view should just show tests defined in the `test` directory, and have a way to exclude discovery in for portions of the project.\r\n\r\n**Please complete the following information:**\r\n\r\n- Dart 3.2.0-39.0.dev (dev) (Fri Aug 4 09:04:57 2023 -0700) on \"macos_arm64\"\r\n- on macos / Version 13.4.1 (c) (Build 22F770820d)\r\n",

Do we need something more explicit?\r\n- [x] 7. the save dialog has a filter `{ \"Dart Files\": [\"dart\"] }`, does this need to come from the server?\r\n- [x] 8. URIs vs paths\r\n- [x] 9. Typed defaultValue/values instead of strings?\r\n- [x] 10. How to add new field types (eg. \"openUri\") in a non-breaking way (eg. if server knows the client supports this functionality, it can send fields with no defaults, but the client might not know how to provide a value if it's a new type)\r\n- [x] 11. Tests for specific parameter `kind`s (ultimately we won't be adding integration tests here for every refactor, but we need coverage of every parameter `kind`)\r\n\r\n@bwilkerson FYI.. once I've resolved the items above I'll likely merge this (it's behind the same `dart.experimentalNewRefactors` flag server is using) to make it easier to work on the server side (at least while no additional client changes are required). Some of the things above may require related server changes though.\r\n\r\nI'm treating this experimental flag as for development only, so don't plan to worry about compatibility until we're ready to remove that.",

This can make debugging super confusing, since the actual behavior of the code doesn't match what the debugger is showing.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nHere's a simple piece of code that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nclass A {\r\n  List list;\r\n  A(this.list) {\r\n    this.list = [3];\r\n\r\n    print(list);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  A([1, 2]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you put a breakpoint on the `print` statement, you'll see two values of `list` depending on whether it is preceded by `this.`.\r\n\r\nWith mouse-over on `list` in the print statement:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/174733a4-76e9-42b9-822c-5099d584199c)\r\n\r\nWith mouse-over on `this.list`, which is the **same variable**:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b03dfbbe-1a3a-4b09-8f22-261a26dc277b)\r\n\r\nYou can also see something similar going on in the variables window:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae91e769-f958-45a1-aa77-76775de18545)\r\n\r\nThe pattern appears to be related to the constructor containing `this.` referencing a field of the class, then whether or not further references to that variable include `this.` or not controls whether you get the latest or a stale value for that variable.\r\n\r\nThe output of the program is as expected:\r\n```\r\n[3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nVariable values shown by the debugger match reality and are consistent, regardless of whether an unnecessary `this.` is included.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n(see above)\r\n\r\n**Please complete the following information:**\r\n\r\nYou can run the **Dart: Collect Diagnostic Information** command from the VS Code command palette (`F1`) to easily capture this information or provide it manually.\r\n\r\n - Operating System and version: Windows 11 + WSL\r\n - VS Code version: 1.95.3\r\n - Dart extension version: v3.102.0\r\n - Dart/Flutter SDK version: 3.5.4 (stable) (None) on \"linux_x64\", no Flutter\r\n - Target device (if the issue relates to Flutter debugging):\r\n\r\nSee details below:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Workspace Environment</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n```text\r\nDart Code extension: 3.102.0\r\n\r\nApp: Visual Studio Code\r\nApp Host: desktop\r\nRemote: wsl\r\nHost Kind: wsl\r\nVersion: linux 1.95.3\r\n\r\nWorkspace type: Dart (LSP)\r\nWorkspace name: thislist [WSL: Ubuntu]\r\n\r\nDart (3.5.4): /usr/lib/dart\r\nFlutter (undefined): undefined (No device)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Output from 'dart info'</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n`/usr/lib/dart/bin/dart info`\r\n\r\nIf providing this information as part of reporting a bug, please review the information\r\nbelow to ensure it only contains things you're comfortable posting publicly.\r\n\r\n#### General info\r\n\r\n- Dart 3.5.4 (stable) (None) on \"linux_x64\"\r\n- on linux / Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Tue Nov 5 00:21:55 UTC 2024\r\n- locale is C.UTF-8\r\n\r\n#### Project info\r\n\r\n- sdk constraint: '^3.5.4'\r\n- dependencies: \r\n- dev_dependencies: lints, test\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Declare a template doccomment on a method in an extension\r\n2. Use elsewhere\r\n3. Hover over method\r\n\r\n```\r\n```dart\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  /// {@macro baz}\r\n  ///\r\n  /// {@macro pink}\r\n  ///\r\n  ///\r\n  ///\r\n  ///\r\n  ///\r\n  ///\r\n  ///\r\n  void bar() {}\r\n\r\n  /// {@template pink}\r\n  /// this works\r\n  /// {@endtemplate}\r\n  void pink() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nextension on Foo {\r\n  /// {@template baz}\r\n  /// This does not work\r\n  /// {@endtemplate}\r\n  void baz() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSee the referenced template.\r\nThe template is shown if running `dart doc`, so this isn't an issue there.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `baz` template isn't rendered in the hover.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"442\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/284d1c54-894c-465d-aa4c-11fc0713264c\">\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Workspace Environment</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n```text\r\nDart Code extension: 3.96.0\r\nFlutter extension: 3.96.0 (not activated)\r\n\r\nApp: Visual Studio Code\r\nApp Host: desktop\r\nRemote: wsl\r\nHost Kind: wsl\r\nVersion: linux 1.93.1\r\n\r\nWorkspace type: Dart (LSP)\r\nWorkspace name: hi [WSL: Ubuntu]\r\n\r\nDart (3.5.3): /home/mick/development/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk\r\nFlutter (3.24.3): /home/mick/development/flutter (No device)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><strong>Output from 'dart info'</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n`/home/mick/development/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart info`\r\n\r\nIf providing this information as part of reporting a bug, please review the information\r\nbelow to ensure it only contains things you're comfortable posting publicly.\r\n\r\n#### General info\r\n\r\n- Dart 3.5.3 (stable) (Wed Sep 11 16:22:47 2024 +0000) on \"linux_x64\"\r\n- on linux / Linux 5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Mar 29 23:14:13 UTC 2024\r\n- locale is C.UTF-8\r\n\r\n#### Project info\r\n\r\n- sdk constraint: '^3.5.3'\r\n- dependencies: \r\n- dev_dependencies: lints, test\r\n\r\n#### Process info\r\n\r\n| Memory |  CPU | Elapsed time | Command line                                                                           |\r\n| -----: | ---: | -----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n|  72 MB | 0.0% |        11:11 | dart devtools --machine --allow-embedding --dtd-uri ws:<path>/4yC8DSkXExpGaiRX         |\r\n| 951 MB | 1.7% |        11:11 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code-Remote --client-version=3.96.0 |\r\n| 544 MB | 1.7% |        10:57 | dart language-server --protocol=lsp --client-id=VS-Code-Remote --client-version=3.96.0 |\r\n|  81 MB | 0.0% |        11:11 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                          |\r\n|  82 MB | 0.0% |        10:57 | dart tooling-daemon --machine                                                          |\r\n|  90 MB | 0.1% |        11:11 | flutter_tools.snapshot daemon --show-web-server-device                                 |\r\n\r\n</details>",
