# Dart SDK 3.5.1

## 3.5.1

- 2024-08-14

- Fixes resolving `include:` in `analysis_options.yaml` file in a nested
  folder in the workspace (issue[#56464][]).
- Fixes source maps generated by `dart compile wasm` when optimizations are
  enabled (issue [#56423][]).
- Fixes a bug in the `dart2wasm` compiler in unsound `-O3` / `-O4` modes where a
  implicit setter for a field of generic type will store `null` instead of the
  field value (issue [#56374][]).
- Fixes a bug in the `dart2wasm` compiler that can trigger in certain situations
  when using partial instantiations of generic tear-offs (constructors or static
  methods) in constant expressions (issue [#56440][]).
- The algorithm for computing the standard upper bound of two types,
  also known is UP, is provided the missing implementation for
  `StructuralParameterType` objects. In some corner cases cases the
  lacking implementation resulted in a crash of the compiler (issue [#56457][]).
