## Moving Beyond "Just Linting"

Static analysis tools are essential, but they are passive. They find issues, but they don't fix architecture, ensure security compliance, or reduce technical debt.

**Saropa Services** bridges the gap between **finding bugs** and **shipping secure, stable software**. We leverage our proprietary analysis engine (1,500+ rules mapped to OWASP standards) to provide high-impact remediation and compliance services for professional Flutter teams.

### OWASP Compliance Ready

Our security rules are mapped to **OWASP Mobile Top 10 (2024)** and **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** standards. This isn't just a linter — it's a **security audit tool** that speaks the language your security team and auditors understand.

| Standard | Categories Covered |
|----------|-------------------|
| OWASP Mobile Top 10 | M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M8, M9, M10 (8/10) |
| OWASP Top 10 Web | A01, A02, A03, A05, A07, A09 (6/10) |

**What this means for you**: Compliance reports that map directly to industry-recognized security standards, not just code style violations.

## Core Service Offerings

### 1. OWASP Security Assessment
**Compliance-ready security audits.**

For teams requiring security compliance documentation or preparing for external audits. We analyze your codebase against OWASP Mobile Top 10 (2024) and OWASP Top 10 (2021) standards.

**The Deliverable:**
A comprehensive PDF Security Assessment including:
- **OWASP Coverage Matrix:** Which categories you pass, which have gaps
- **Violation Details:** Specific code locations with severity and remediation guidance
- **Compliance Summary:** Executive summary suitable for auditors and stakeholders
- **Remediation Roadmap:** Prioritized fixes by risk level

**Standards Covered:**
| OWASP Mobile | OWASP Web |
|--------------|-----------|
| M1 Credential Usage | A01 Broken Access Control |
| M3 Authentication | A02 Cryptographic Failures |
| M4 Input Validation | A03 Injection |
| M5 Communication | A05 Misconfiguration |
| M6 Privacy Controls | A07 Authentication Failures |
| M8 Misconfiguration | A09 Logging Failures |
| M9 Data Storage | |
| M10 Cryptography | |

**Best For:** FinTech, Healthcare, Government, App Store compliance, security audits, due diligence.

### 2. Technical Debt Remediation
**Clean up the mess without stopping development.**

Many teams want to adopt stricter linting but are blocked by thousands of legacy warnings. We use our **Baseline Technology** to snapshot your current state, allowing you to enforce high standards on *new* code immediately while we systematically burn down the legacy debt.

**We handle:**
- Configuration of the **Baseline** to silence legacy noise.
- Systematic refactoring of critical issues (Null safety, Async gaps, Resources).
- CI/CD integration to prevent regression.

**Best For:** Mature apps with significant technical debt or teams upgrading strictness tiers.

### 3. Compliance & Security Retainer
**Continuous OWASP compliance for regulated industries.**

For FinTech, Healthcare, and Government applications where "good enough" isn't acceptable. We act as your external code quality assurance team.

**Includes:**
- **Monthly OWASP Compliance Reports:** Proof of adherence to OWASP Mobile Top 10 and Web Top 10 standards
- **Trend Analysis:** Track security posture improvements over time
- **Custom Rule Maintenance:** Updates to rules as your internal architecture evolves
- **Dependency Audits:** Proactive warnings about deprecated or insecure packages (covers OWASP M2/A06 gaps)
- **Remediation Support:** Guidance on fixing identified vulnerabilities

**Best For:** Regulated industries requiring audit trails, continuous compliance monitoring, and guaranteed stability.

### Custom Rule Development
**Enforce your architecture.**

Generic rules catch generic bugs. **Custom rules catch architectural violations.** We build rules specific to your team's conventions so that "doing the right thing" becomes the path of least resistance.

**Examples:**
- "All Repositories must handle `DioException`."
- "UI Widgets cannot import `infrastructure` layer directly."
- "Analytics events must follow the `event_verb_noun` naming convention."

### Migration Services
**Switching tools?**

If you are moving from **Dart Code Metrics (DCM)**, **Very Good Analysis**, or **Effective Dart**, we handle the transition. We map your existing rules to Saropa equivalents, ensuring no drop in coverage while unlocking hundreds of new checks.
