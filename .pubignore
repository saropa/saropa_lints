# Exclude files that break pub.dev analysis or shouldn't be published

# The .pubignore file tells pub publish which files to exclude when publishing your package to pub.dev.

# How it works:

# Similar to .gitignore, but specifically for publishing
# Files listed here won't be included in the published package
# Keeps your published package smaller and cleaner
# Prevents development-only files from being uploaded

# Generated API documentation (pub.dev generates its own)
doc/api/
dartdoc-log.txt
dartdoc_options.yaml

# Log files
*.log

# Example package files (path dependencies break pana analysis)
# Keep example/example.md for pub.dev documentation tab
