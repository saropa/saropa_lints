# BUG: assertion-free stub tests that always pass without testing anything

**Severity**: High — test suite gives partial false confidence
**Date**: 2026-03-25 (rebaselined 2026-06-10)
**Status**: Phase 1 DONE (stubs removed); Phase 2 (real tests) pending

## Two phases

The work splits cleanly:

- **Phase 1 — remove the stubs everywhere (DONE 2026-06-10).** Empty-body
  `test`/`testWidgets` (`() {}`) is bad design regardless of replacement: it
  always passes and asserts nothing. 396 empty-body stubs were deleted, plus
  255 `group()` blocks that those deletions left empty (651 statements across
  47 files). Empty-body count is now **0**, hard-gated by
  [test/integrity/stub_test_guard_test.dart](../test/integrity/stub_test_guard_test.dart)
  via `scanEmptyBodyStubTests`. Full suite green (5,726 tests).
- **Phase 2 — write real fixture-backed tests (pending).** Replace the lost
  coverage with assertions that the rule actually fires (and stays quiet on
  compliant code), using the resolved-analyzer oracle proven below.

27 assertion-free tests remain and are deliberately KEPT — they are real tests
the broad heuristic miscounts: "does not throw" tests (the assertion is the
absence of an exception) and helper-asserted tests (`expectFixtureExists(...)`).
The empty-body gate does not flag them.

## Phase 2 oracle (built & validated 2026-06-10)

A resolved-analyzer harness runs a single rule in-process against a fixture with
full type/element resolution (no `custom_lint`, which this package does not use
— see below). Validated: it fires `avoid_unawaited_future:12`,
`check_mounted_after_async:12`, `avoid_async_in_build:8`, `avoid_redundant_await:10,12`
at the exact expected lines. Mechanics: `AnalysisContextCollection.getResolvedUnit`
→ build a `RuleContext` whose `typeProvider`/`typeSystem`/`libraryElement` come
from the `ResolvedUnitResult` → `rule.registerNodeProcessors` → set
`rule.reporter` → walk the resolved unit with `ScanWalker` → flush
`afterLibrary` callbacks. Run ONE rule at a time (running all comprehensive
rules triggers an unrelated cross-file rule's whole-project scan).

## Gates (all green)

Three regression gates in [test/integrity/stub_test_guard_test.dart](../test/integrity/stub_test_guard_test.dart),
wired into the normal `dart test` run so they execute in CI and in publish
Step 7:

- **empty-body `test`/`testWidgets` (`() {}`)** — count **0**, hard `isEmpty`
  gate via `scanEmptyBodyStubTests`. This is the precise "stub" invariant.
  A `test(..., () {}, skip: '...')` is excluded: a skipped test never runs, so
  its empty body cannot silently pass — it is a documented placeholder for an
  un-runnable case, not a coverage-faking stub (added 2026-06-14 after such a
  placeholder in `widget_lifecycle_fp_test.dart` turned the gate red).
- `expect(true, isTrue)` — **0**.
- `expect('<literal>', isNotNull)` — **0**.

- **publish.py audit gate (non-overridable)** — `run_stub_guard_check` in
  `scripts/modules/_audit.py` runs the guard test during the audit and feeds
  `AuditResult.stub_guard_passed` into `has_blocking_issues`. A reintroduced
  stub blocks publish with the audit's exit code (11), so it cannot be waved
  through the interactive "continue despite test failure" prompt in Step 7.

### Phase 2 backlog — files that lost stub coverage (count = stubs removed)

These are the files whose empty-body `SHOULD trigger` / `should NOT trigger`
placeholders were deleted in Phase 1; each is a candidate for real
fixture-backed tests via the Phase 2 oracle. (Counts are the original stub
totals per file; regenerate current state with `scanStubTests('.')`.)

## Phase 2 oracle — why not `custom_lint`, and the two fallbacks tried

`custom_lint` is the faithful pipeline, but **this package does not use it** —
the root pubspec builds directly on `analyzer_plugin`, with no `custom_lint` /
`custom_lint_builder` dependency. `dart run custom_lint` fails outright, which
is why [test/scan/fixture_lint_integration_test.dart](../test/scan/fixture_lint_integration_test.dart)
always takes its `if (fromCustom.isEmpty) return` escape and only asserts the
native compile-time rules `dart analyze` emits. Adding `custom_lint` would mean
rewriting all rules onto another framework — off the table.

`ScanRunner` ([lib/src/scan/scan_runner.dart](../lib/src/scan/scan_runner.dart))
is in-process and fast but **parse-only** (`parseString`, no type/element
resolution): only 1 of 9 architecture rules fire under it. Useful for syntactic
rules; blind to semantic/cross-file ones.

The chosen oracle is the **resolved-analyzer harness** described at the top —
no new dependency, faithful for syntactic AND semantic rules. (To use ScanRunner
for syntactic-only checks, note it excludes any `/example` path unless you pass
`applyExclusionsToFileList: false`.)

Phase 2 also has to fix a defect class the stubs hid: **fake fixtures**, e.g.
`avoid_god_class`'s "BAD" class `_bad79_AppManager` is empty — a comment claims
"20+ fields and 30+ methods" but there are none, so the rule correctly stays
quiet. Each Phase 2 conversion must verify its fixture actually contains the
violating pattern.

## Done criteria

- [x] Empty-body stub count = **0**, hard-gated.
- [ ] Each removed stub's intended coverage is restored by a fixture-backed
      assertion (trigger + non-trigger) under the resolved-analyzer oracle.
- [x] A **non-overridable** stub gate runs in `publish.py`'s audit phase
      (blocking exit code), not only in the wave-through-able Step 7 `dart test`.

## History

- 2026-03-25: filed at 3,530 regex-literal stubs / 103 files.
- 2026-04-04 → 04-27: regex-literal stubs driven to 0; `expect(true, isTrue)`
  guard + literal-`isNotNull` ratchet added.
- 2026-06-10: rebaselined onto the AST definition (423 assertion-free / 51
  files). **Phase 1**: deleted 396 empty-body stubs + 255 orphaned `group()`
  blocks (651 statements, 47 files); switched the guard to a hard empty-body=0
  gate (`scanEmptyBodyStubTests`); kept 27 legitimate assertion-free tests;
  full suite green (5,726). Built & validated the Phase 2 resolved-analyzer
  oracle.

## Finish Report (2026-06-10)

**Scope:** (A) Dart analyzer-plugin code + (C) docs/scripts. No rule-behavior
change, no extension/UI change. Phase 1 (stub removal) and the non-overridable
publish gate are complete; Phase 2 (writing real fixture-backed tests) is
deferred and remains tracked above.

**Deep review:**
- `stub_density.dart`: `scanEmptyBodyStubTests` / `emptyBodyStubCountIn` mirror
  the existing `scanStubTests` / `stubCountIn` structure (same visitor pattern,
  `firstOrNull`-safe argument access). Empty-body = `BlockFunctionBody` with
  zero statements — a comment-only body is correctly still "empty" (comments
  are not AST statements), pinned by a test.
- `stub_test_guard_test.dart`: empty-body gate uses `isEmpty` (hard zero), not
  a ratchet — chosen over gating the broader assertion-free metric because that
  metric has 27 legitimate hits (does-not-throw and helper-asserted tests) that
  must not be force-deleted. The two literal-tautology regex guards are kept.
- `_audit.py`: `run_stub_guard_check` shells out to the canonical Dart guard
  test (single source of truth — no reimplemented AST detection in Python),
  uses `get_shell_mode()` for Windows `dart` resolution, and treats a missing
  test file as FAIL so the gate can't silently pass. `stub_guard_passed` feeds
  `AuditResult.has_blocking_issues` (publish exit code 11); the blocking reason
  is surfaced in `_publish_steps.py`.

**Testing:**
- 4A audit: the only tests referencing changed symbols are
  `stub_test_guard_test.dart` (updated) and `fix_and_stub_test.dart` (tests the
  unchanged `stubCountIn` — not broken). No assertion pinned a deleted stub.
- 4B new tests: added an `emptyBodyStubCountIn` group to `fix_and_stub_test.dart`
  (empty block, `testWidgets`, comment-only body all count; non-empty body does
  not — with an explicit contrast assertion that `stubCountIn` still flags it).
- Ran: `dart test test/project_health/fix_and_stub_test.dart` (9 pass),
  `dart test test/integrity/stub_test_guard_test.dart` (3 pass), the 5
  heavily-edited rule-test files (pass), and the full suite (5,726 pass).
  Guard FAIL path verified by injecting a temp stub (blocked, then removed).
- `dart analyze --fatal-infos` on the changed Dart files: no issues.

**Maintenance:** CHANGELOG updated (2 Maintenance entries: Phase 1 removal +
audit gate). README verified — no updates needed (no rule/test count cited).
ROADMAP — N/A (no lint entry completed). Guides reviewed — nothing user-facing.
No bug archive — task did not close a `bugs/*.md` file.

**Plan disposition:** stays ACTIVE, not moved/split. Phase 2 is tracked in this
plan and deferred; the remaining scope is a self-contained, unstarted phase
documented above. Deliberate deviation from the A-MOVE "split or archive"
default.

**Outstanding:** Phase 2 — author real fixture-backed trigger/non-trigger tests
via the resolved-analyzer oracle for the rules whose stub placeholders were
removed; fix fake fixtures (e.g. `avoid_god_class`'s empty BAD class) as
encountered.

**Files:** `test/project_health/fix_and_stub_test.dart`
(new `emptyBodyStubCountIn` tests), `plans/BUG_stub_tests_in_suite.md` (this
report). Phase 1 + gate code landed earlier in commits `b086d7d6` and
`29d62604` (gate code swept into a concurrent session's commit `0f739a8d`).

## Finish Report (2026-06-14)

**Scope:** (A) Dart analyzer-plugin tooling + (C) docs. The empty-body
stub-test gate (`scanEmptyBodyStubTests` /
[stub_density.dart](../lib/src/cli/project_health/stub_density.dart)) was a hard
zero gate that counted any `test`/`testWidgets` whose callback is an empty block
(`() {}`). A deliberately-skipped placeholder —
`test('removeListener detection (Flutter-gated; not oracle-runnable)', () {}, skip: '...')`
in [widget_lifecycle_fp_test.dart](../test/rules/widget/widget_lifecycle_fp_test.dart)
— documents an un-runnable case (the rule returns early unless
`isFlutterProject`, which the Flutter-less example package cannot satisfy). A
`skip:`-ped test never executes, so its empty body cannot silently pass, yet the
gate counted it and turned the guard test, CI, and the publish audit gate
(exit 11) red. No real stub had been reintroduced; the gate's definition was too
broad. Phase 2 (writing fixture-backed tests for the removed-stub backlog)
remains deferred and is unaffected.

**Deep review:**
- `stub_density.dart`: `_EmptyBodyStubVisitor.visitMethodInvocation` now checks
  for a `skip:` named argument before counting an empty body. The exclusion is
  scoped to the empty-body visitor only — `_StubVisitor` (the broader
  assertion-free heuristic) and `_AssertionDetector` are untouched. The
  rationale is documented inline at the check, naming the failure mode (a
  documented placeholder turning the gate red).
- The check reads `NamedExpression.name.label.name == 'skip'`, matching the
  package:test `skip:` parameter on both `test` and `testWidgets`. It does not
  attempt to evaluate the skip value (a `skip: false` would still be excluded);
  in practice the value is always a non-empty reason string, and a `skip: false`
  empty-body test is itself meaningless, so the simpler name-presence check is
  correct and avoids const-evaluation in a parse-only visitor.

**Testing:**
- 4A audit: the only tests referencing `emptyBodyStubCountIn` are
  `test/project_health/fix_and_stub_test.dart` (extended here) and
  `test/integrity/stub_test_guard_test.dart` (the live gate). No assertion
  pinned the pre-fix "skipped empty body counts" behavior.
- 4B new tests: added two cases to the `emptyBodyStubCountIn` group — a skipped
  empty-body test is not counted, and (the over-reach guard) an empty-body test
  with a non-`skip` named argument is still counted.
- Ran `dart test test/project_health/fix_and_stub_test.dart test/integrity/stub_test_guard_test.dart`
  — 14 pass (the empty-body gate, formerly red, is green). The same guard run
  was confirmed red before the fix (1 empty-body stub in
  `widget_lifecycle_fp_test.dart`).
- `dart analyze --fatal-infos` on the changed Dart files: no issues.

**Maintenance:** CHANGELOG updated (1 Maintenance entry: the gate no longer
fails on a skipped placeholder). README verified — no updates needed (no rule or
test count cited). ROADMAP — N/A (no lint entry changed). Guides reviewed —
nothing user-facing. No bug archive — task did not close a `bugs/*.md` file.

**Plan disposition:** stays ACTIVE, not moved/split. This task closed none of
the plan's remaining scope (Phase 2); it restored the already-complete Phase 1
gate to green after a definition gap let a legitimate skipped placeholder trip
it. Phase 2 remains the outstanding work.
